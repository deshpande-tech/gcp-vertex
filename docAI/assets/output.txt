Organizations With Significant Trading
Activity
AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, Treasury; the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve
System; and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.
SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
are inviting public comment on a notice
of proposed rulemaking (proposal) that
would substantially revise the capital
requirements applicable to large
banking organizations and to banking
organizations with significant trading
activity. The revisions set forth in the
proposal would improve the calculation
of risk-based capital requirements to
better reflect the risks of these banking
organizations’ exposures, reduce the
complexity of the framework, enhance
the consistency of requirements across
these banking organizations, and
facilitate more effective supervisory and
market assessments of capital adequacy.
The revisions would include replacing
current requirements that include the
use of banking organizations’ internal
models for credit risk and operational
risk with standardized approaches and
replacing the current market risk and
credit valuation adjustment risk
requirements with revised approaches.
The proposed revisions would be
generally consistent with recent changes
to international capital standards issued
by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision. The proposal would not
amend the capital requirements

applicable to smaller, less complex
banking organizations.

Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 179 / Monday, September 18, 2023 / Proposed Rules
of the Federal Reserve System (Board),
and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the
agencies) are proposing to modify the
capital requirements applicable to
banking organizations 1 with total assets
of $100 billion or more and their
subsidiary depository institutions (large
banking organizations) and to banking
organizations with significant trading
activity. The revisions set forth in the
proposal would strengthen the
calculation of risk-based capital
requirements to better reflect the risks of
these banking organizations’ exposures.
In addition, the proposed revisions
would enhance the consistency of
requirements across large banking
organizations and facilitate more
effective supervisory and market
assessments of capital adequacy.
Following the 2007–09 financial
crisis, the agencies adopted an initial set
of reforms to improve the effectiveness
of and address weaknesses in the
regulatory capital framework. For
example, in 2013, the agencies adopted
a final rule that increased the quantity
and quality of regulatory capital banking
organizations must maintain.2 These
changes were broadly consistent with an
initial set of reforms published by the
Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (Basel Committee)
following the financial crisis.3 The
Board also implemented capital
planning and stress testing requirements
for large bank holding companies and
savings and loan holding companies 4
and an additional capital buffer
requirement to mitigate the financial
stability risks posed by U.S. global
1The term ‘‘banking organizations’’ includes
national banks, state member banks, state
nonmember banks, Federal savings associations,
state savings associations, top-tier bank holding
companies domiciled in the United States not
subject to the Board’s Small Bank Holding
Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company
Policy Statement (12 CFR part 225, appendix C),
U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign
banking organizations, and top-tier savings and loan
holding companies domiciled in the United States,
except for certain savings and loan holding
companies that are substantially engaged in
insurance underwriting or commercial activities
and savings and loan holding companies that are
subject to the Small Bank Holding Company and
Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy
Statement.
2The Board and the OCC issued a joint final rule
on October 11, 2013 (78 FR 62018) and the FDIC
issued a substantially identical interim final rule on
September 10, 2013 (78 FR 55340). In April 2014,
the FDIC adopted the interim final rule as a final
rule with no substantive changes. 79 FR 20754
(April 14, 2014).

of central banks and banking supervisory
authorities, which was established by the central
bank governors of the G–10 countries in 1975.

systemically important banking
organizations (GSIBs),5 as well as other
enhanced prudential standards,
consistent with the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act).6
by
The proposal would build on these
initial reforms by making additional
changes developed in response to the
2007–09 financial crisis and informed
by experience since the crisis.
Requirements under the proposal would
generally be consistent with
international capital standards issued
the Basel Committee, commonly known
as the Basel III reforms.7 Where
appropriate, the proposal differs from
the Basel III reforms to reflect, for
example, specific characteristics of U.S.
markets, requirements under U.S.
generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP),8 practices of U.S.
banking organizations, and U.S. legal
requirements and policy objectives.
The proposal would strengthen risk-
based capital requirements for large
banking organizations by improving
their comprehensiveness and risk
sensitivity. These proposed revisions,
including removal of certain internal
models, would increase capital
requirements in the aggregate, in
particular for those banking
organizations with heightened risk
profiles. Increased capital requirements
can produce both economic costs and
benefits. The agencies assessed the
likely effect of the proposal on
economic activity and resilience, and
expect that the benefits of strengthening
capital requirements for large banking
organizations outweigh the costs.9
Historical experience has
demonstrated the impact individual
banking organizations can have on the
stability of the U.S. banking system, in
particular banking organizations that
would have been subject to the
proposal. Large banking organizations
that experience an increase in their
capital requirements resulting from the
proposal would be expected to be able
to absorb losses with reduced disruption
to financial intermediation in the U.S.
economy. Enhanced resilience of the
banking sector supports more stable
lending through the economic cycle and
diminishes the likelihood of financial
crises and their associated costs.

in section V of this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.
The agencies seek comment on all
aspects of the proposal.
A. Overview of the Proposal
The proposal would improve the risk
capture and consistency of capital
requirements across large banking
organizations and reduce complexity
and operational costs through changes
across multiple areas of the agencies’
risk-based capital framework. For most
parts of the framework, the proposal
would eliminate the use of banking
organizations’ internal models to set
regulatory capital requirements and in
their place apply a simpler and more
consistent standardized framework. For
market risk, the proposal would retain
banking organizations’ ability to use
internal models, with an improved
models-based measure for market risk
that better accounts for potential losses.
The
use of internal models would be
subject to enhanced requirements for
model approval and performance and a
new ‘‘output floor’’ to limit the extent to
which a banking organization’s internal
models may reduce its overall capital
requirement. The proposal would also
adopt new standardized approaches for
market risk and credit valuation
adjustment (CVA) risk that better reflect
the risks of banking organizations’
exposures.
This new framework for calculating
risk-weighted assets (the expanded risk-
based approach) would apply to
banking organizations with total assets
of $100 billion or more and their
subsidiary depository institutions. The
revised requirements for market risk
would also apply to other banking
organizations with $5 billion or more in
trading assets plus trading liabilities or
for which trading assets plus trading
liabilities exceed 10 percent of total
assets.
The expanded risk-based approach
would be more risk-sensitive than the
current U.S. standardized approach by
incorporating more credit-risk drivers
(for example, borrower and loan
characteristics) and explicitly
differentiating between more types of
risk (for example, operational risk,
credit valuation adjustment risk). In this
manner, the expanded risk-based
approach would better account for key
risks faced by large banking
organizations. The proposed changes
would also enhance the alignment of
capital requirements to the risks of
banking organizations’ exposures and
increase incentives for prudent risk
management.
To ensure that large banking
organizations would not have lower
capital requirements than smaller, less
complex banking organizations, the

Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 179 / Monday, September 18, 2023 / Proposed Rules
proposal would maintain the capital
rule’s dual-requirement structure. Under
this structure, a large banking
organization would be required to
calculate its risk-based capital ratios
under both the new expanded risk-
based approach and the standardized
approach (including market risk, as
applicable), and use the lower of the
two for each risk-based capital ratio.10
All capital buffer requirements,
including the stress capital buffer
requirement, would apply regardless of
whether the expanded risk-based
approach or the existing standardized
approach produces the lower ratio.
For banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards,11
the proposal would align the calculation
of regulatory capital—the numerator of
the regulatory capital ratios—with the
calculation for banking organizations
subject to Category I or II capital
standards, providing the same approach
for all large banking organizations.
Banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards
would be subject to the same treatment
of accumulated other comprehensive
income (AOCI), capital deductions, and
rules for minority interest as banking
organizations subject to Category I or II
capital standards. This change would
help ensure that the regulatory capital
ratios of these banking organizations
better reflect their capacity to absorb
losses, including by taking into account
10Banking organizations’ risk-based capital ratios
are the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1
capital ratio, and total capital ratio. See 12 CFR 3.10
(OCC), 12 CFR 217.10 (Board), and 12 CFR 324.10
(FDIC).
11 In 2019, the agencies adopted rules establishing
four categories of capital standards for U.S. banking
organizations with $100 billion or more in total
assets and foreign banking organizations with $100
billion or more in combined U.S. assets. Under this
framework, Category I capital standards apply to
U.S. global systemically important bank holding
companies and their depository institution
subsidiaries. Category II capital standards apply to
banking organizations with at least $700 billion in
total consolidated assets or at least $75 billion in
cross-jurisdictional activity and their depository
institution subsidiaries. Category III capital
standards apply to banking organizations with total
consolidated assets of at least $250 billion or at
least $75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale
funding, nonbank assets, or off-balance sheet
exposure and their depository institution
subsidiaries. Category IV capital standards apply to
banking organizations with total consolidated assets
of at least $100 billion that do not meet the
thresholds for a higher category and their
depository institution subsidiaries. See 12 CFR 3.2
(OCC), 12 CFR 252.5, 12 CFR 238.10 (Board), 12
CFR 324.2 (FDIC); ‘‘Prudential Standards for Large
Bank Holding Companies, Savings and Loan
Holding Companies, and Foreign Banking
Organizations,’’ 84 FR 59032 (November 1, 2019);
and ‘‘Changes to Applicability Thresholds for
Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements,’’ 84
FR 59230 (November 1, 2019).
unrealized losses or gains on securities
positions reflected in AOCI.
The proposal would expand
application of the supplementary
leverage ratio and the countercyclical
capital buffer to banking organizations
subject to Category IV capital standards.
This change would bring further
alignment of capital requirements across
large banking organizations and is
consistent with the proposal’s goal of
strengthening the resilience of large
banking organizations.
The proposal would also introduce
enhanced disclosure requirements to
facilitate market participants’
understanding of a banking
organization’s financial condition and
risk management practices. Also, the
proposal would align Federal Reserve’s
regulatory reporting requirements with
the changes to capital requirements. The
agencies anticipate that revisions to the
reporting forms of the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council
(FFIEC) applicable to large banking
organizations and to banking
organizations with significant trading
activity will be proposed in the near
future, which would align with the
proposed revisions to the capital rule.
The proposed changes would take
effect subject to the transition
provisions described in section IV of
this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.
The revisions introduced by the
proposal would interact with several
Board rules, including by modifying the
risk-weighted assets used to calculate
total loss-absorbing capacity
requirements, long-term debt
requirements, and the short-term
wholesale funding score included in the
GSIB surcharge method 2 score. Also,
the proposal would revise the
calculation of single-counterparty credit
limits by removing the option of using
a banking organization’s internal models
to calculate derivatives exposure
amounts and requiring the use of the
standardized approach for counterparty
credit risk for this purpose. The
proposal would also remove the
exemption from calculating risk-
weighted assets under subpart E of the
capital rule currently available to U.S.
intermediate holding companies of
foreign banking organizations under the
Board’s enhanced prudential standards.
In parallel, the Board is issuing a
notice of proposed rulemaking revising
the GSIB surcharge calculation
applicable to GSIBs and the systemic
risk report applicable to large banking
organizations.12
12On October 24, 2019, the Board published in
the Federal Register a notice of proposed
rulemaking inviting comment on a proposal to
64031
Question 1: The Board invites
comment on the interaction of the
revisions under the proposal with other
existing rules and with the other notice
of proposed rulemaking. In particular,
comment is invited on the impact of the
proposal on the single-counterparty
credit limit framework. What are the
advantages and disadvantages of the
proposed approach? Which alternatives,
if any, should the Board consider and
why?
B. Use of Internal Models Under the
Proposed Framework
The proposal would remove the use of
internal models to set credit risk and
operational risk capital requirements
(the so-called advanced approaches) for
banking organizations subject to
Category I or II capital standards. These
internal models rely on a banking
organization’s choice of modeling
assumptions and supporting data. Such
model assumptions include a degree of
subjectivity, which can result in varying
risk-based capital requirements for
similar exposures. Moreover, empirical
verification of modeling choices can
require many years of historical
experience because severe credit risk
and operational risk losses can occur
infrequently. In the agencies’ previous
observations, the advanced approaches
have produced unwarranted variability
across banking organizations in
requirements for exposures with similar
risks.13 This unwarranted variability,
combined with the complexity of these
models-based approaches, can reduce
confidence in the validity of the
modeled outputs, lessen the
transparency of the risk-based capital
ratios, and challenge comparisons of
capital adequacy across banking
organizations.
Standardization of credit and
operational risk capital requirements
would improve the consistency of
requirements. Standardized
requirements, together with robust
public disclosure and reporting
requirements, would enhance the
transparency of capital requirements
and the ability of supervisors and
market participants to make
independent assessments of a banking
. 
establish risk-based capital requirements for
depository institution holding companies

organization’s capital adequacy,
individually and relative to its peers.
The use of robust, risk-sensitive
standardized approaches for credit and
operational risk would also improve the
efficiency of the capital framework by
reducing operational costs. Under the
advanced approaches, banking
organizations subject to Category I or II
capital standards must develop and
maintain internal modeling systems to
determine capital requirements, which
may differ from the risk measurement
approaches they use to monitor risk for
internal assessments. Further, any
material changes to a banking
organization’s internal models must be
fully documented and presented to the
banking organization’s primary Federal
supervisor for review.14 Replacing the
use of internal models with
standardized approaches would reduce
costs associated with maintaining such
modeling systems and eliminate the
associated submissions to the agencies.
Eliminating the use of internal models
to set credit and operational risk capital
requirements would not reduce the
overall risk capture of the regulatory
framework. In addition to the
calculation of expanded risk-based
approach and standardized approach
capital requirements, a large banking
organization would continue to be
required to maintain capital
commensurate with the level and nature
of all risks to which the banking
organization is exposed,15 to have a
process for assessing its overall capital
adequacy in relation to its risk profile
and a comprehensive strategy for
maintaining an appropriate level of
capital,16 and, where applicable, to
conduct internal stress tests.17 Also,
holding companies subject to the
Board’s capital plan rule would
continue to be subject to a stress capital
buffer requirement that is based on a
supervisory stress test of the holding
company’s exposures.18 Although the
proposal would remove use of internal
models for calculating capital
requirements for credit and operational
risk, internal models can provide
valuable information to a banking
organization’s internal stress testing,
capital planning, and risk
management
functions. Large banking organizations
should employ internal modeling

capabilities as appropriate for the
complexity of their activities.
The proposal would continue to allow
use of internal models to set market risk
capital requirements for portfolios
where modeling can be demonstrated to
be appropriate. In addition, the proposal
would provide for conservative but risk-
sensitive standardized alternatives
where modeling is not supported. In
contrast to credit and operational risk,
market risk data allows for daily
feedback on model performance to
support empirical verification. The
proposal would limit the use of models
to only those trading desks for which a
banking organization has received
approval from its primary Federal
supervisor. Ongoing use of such models
would depend upon a banking
organization’s ability to demonstrate
through robust testing that the models
are sufficiently conservative and
accurate for purposes of calculating
market risk capital requirements. In
cases where a banking organization
cannot demonstrate acceptable
performance of its internal models for a
given trading desk, the banking
organization would be required to use
the standardized measure for market
risk which acts as a risk-sensitive
alternative.
II. Scope of Application
The proposal’s expanded risk-based
approach would apply to banking
organizations with total assets of $100
billion or more and their subsidiary
depository institutions.19 These banking
organizations are large and exhibit
heightened complexity. Application of
the expanded risk-based approach to
large banking organizations would
provide granular, generally standardized
requirements that result in robust risk
capture and appropriate risk sensitivity.
By strengthening the requirements that
apply to large banking organizations, the
proposal would enhance their resilience
and reduce risks to U.S. financial
stability and costs they may pose to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Fund in case
of material distress or failure. Relative to
smaller, less complex banking
organizations, these banking
organizations have greater operational
capacity to apply more sophisticated
requirements.
Previously, the agencies determined
that the advanced approaches
19The proposal would also apply to depository
institutions with total assets of $100 billion or more
that are not consolidated subsidiaries of depository
institution holding companies, and to depository
institutions with total assets of $100 billion or more
that are subsidiaries of depository institution
holding companies that are not assigned a category
under the capital rule.
requirements should not apply to
banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards, as
the agencies considered such
requirements to be overly complex and
burdensome relative to the safety and
soundness benefits that they would
provide for these banking
organizations.20 The expanded risk-
based approach generally is based on
standardized requirements, which
would be less complex and costly. In
addition, recent events demonstrate the
impact banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards can
have on financial stability. While the
recent failure of banking organizations
subject to Category IV capital standards
may be attributed to a variety of factors,
the effect of these failures on financial
stability supports further alignment of
the regulatory capital framework across
large banking organizations.
Banking organizations with
significant trading activities are subject
to substantial market risk and, therefore,
would be subject to market risk capital
requirements. Recognizing that the
dollar-based threshold for the
application of market risk requirements
was established in 1996, the proposal
would increase this dollar-based
threshold from $1 billion to $5 billion
of trading assets plus trading liabilities.
Banking organizations would also
continue to be subject to market risk
requirements if their trading assets plus
trading liabilities represent 10 percent
or more of total assets. The proposal
would revise the calculation of the
dollar-based threshold amount to be
based on four-quarter averages of
trading assets and trading liabilities
instead of point-in-time amounts.
Banking organizations that would no
longer meet these minimum thresholds
for being subject to market risk capital
requirements would calculate risk-
weighted assets for trading exposures
under the standardized approach.
Additionally, under the proposal, large
banking organizations would be subject
to market risk capital requirements
regardless of trading activities.
The proposal would expand
application of the countercyclical
capital buffer to banking organizations
subject to Category IV capital standards.
The countercyclical capital buffer is a
macroprudential tool that can be used to
increase the resilience of the financial
system by increasing capital
requirements for large banking
organizations during a period of

elevated risk of above-normal losses.
Failure or distress of a banking
organization with assets of $100 billion
or more during a time of elevated risk
or stress can have significant
destabilizing effects for other banking
organizations and the broader financial
system—even if the banking
organization does not meet the criteria
for being subject to Category II or III
capital standards. Applying the
countercyclical capital buffer to banking
organizations subject to Category IV
capital standards would increase the
resilience of these banking organizations
and, in turn, improve the resilience of
the broader financial system. The
proposed approach also has the
potential to moderate fluctuations in the
supply of credit over time. The proposal
would also modify how the
countercyclical capital buffer amount is
determined to reflect the proposed
changes to market risk capital
requirements. Specifically, the risk-
weighted asset amount for private sector
credit exposures that are market risk
covered positions under the proposal
would be determined using the
standardized default risk capital
requirement for such positions rather
than using the specific risk add-on of
the current rule.
The proposal also would expand
application of the supplementary
leverage ratio requirement to banking
organizations subject to Category IV
capital standards. In contrast to the risk-
based capital requirements, a leverage
ratio does not differentiate the amount
of capital required by exposure type.
Rather, a leverage ratio puts a simple
and transparent limit on banking
organization leverage. Leverage
requirements protect against
underestimation of risk both by banking
organizations and by risk-based capital
requirements and serve as a
complement to risk-based capital
requirements. The supplementary
leverage ratio measures tier 1 capital
relative to total leverage exposure,
which includes on-balance sheet assets
and certain off-balance sheet exposures.
The proposed change would ensure that
all large banking organizations are
subject to a consistent and robust
leverage requirement that serves as a
complement to risk-based capital
requirements and takes into account on-
and off-balance sheet exposures.
Question 2: What are the advantages
and disadvantages of applying the
expanded risk-based approach to
banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards? To
what extent is the expanded risk-based
approach appropriate for banking
organizations with different risk
profiles, including from a cost and
operational burden perspective? Are
there specific areas, such as the market
risk capital framework, for which the
agencies should consider a materiality
threshold to better balance cost and
operational burden and risk sensitivity,
and if so what should that threshold be
and why? What would the appropriate
exposure treatment be for banking
organizations with such exposures
beneath any materiality threshold, and
how would that treatment be consistent
with the overall calibration of the
expanded risk-based approach? What
alternatives, if any, should the agencies
consider to help ensure that the risks of
large banking organizations are
appropriately captured under minimum
risk-based capital requirements and
why?
Question 3: What are the advantages
and disadvantages of harmonizing the
calculation of regulatory capital across
large banking organizations? What are
any unintended consequences of the
proposal and what steps should the
agencies consider to mitigate those
consequences? What are the advantages
and disadvantages of harmonizing the
calculation of regulatory capital across
large banking organizations and using
different approaches (for example, the
expanded risk-based approach and the
U.S. standardized approach) for the
calculation of risk-weighted assets?
Question 4: What are the advantages
and disadvantages of applying the
countercyclical capital buffer and
supplementary leverage ratio to banking
organizations subject to Category IV
capital standards?
III. Proposed Changes to the Capital
Rule
A. Calculation of Capital Ratios and
Application of Buffer Requirements
Under the proposal, large banking
organizations would be required to
calculate total risk-weighted assets
under two approaches: (1) the expanded
risk-based approach, and (2) the
standardized approach. Total risk-
weighted assets under the expanded
risk-based approach (expanded total
risk-weighted assets) would equal the
sum of risk-weighted assets for credit
risk, equity risk, operational risk, market
risk, and CVA risk, as described in this
proposal, minus any amount of the
banking organization’s adjusted
allowance for credit losses that is not
included in tier 2 capital and any
amount of allocated transfer risk
reserves. For calculating standardized
total risk-weighted assets, the proposal
would revise the methodology for
determining market risk-weighted assets
64033
and would require banking
organizations subject to Category III or
IV capital standards to use the
standardized approach for counterparty
credit risk (SA–CCR) for derivative
exposures.21
To determine its applicable risk-based
capital ratios, a large banking
organization would calculate two sets of
risk-based capital ratios (common equity
tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio,
and total capital ratio), one using
expanded total risk-weighted assets and
one using standardized total risk-
weighted assets. A banking
organization’s common equity tier 1
capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, and
total capital ratio would be the lower of
each ratio of the two approaches.
The proposal would not change the
minimum risk-based capital ratios
under the capital rule. Also, the capital
conservation buffer would continue to
apply to risk-based capital ratios as
under the capital rule, except that the
stress capital buffer requirement—a
component of the capital conservation
buffer that is applicable to banking
organizations subject to the Board’s
capital plan rule—would apply to a
banking organization’s risk-based
capital ratios regardless of whether the
ratios result from the expanded risk-
based approach or the standardized
approach.
Question 5: What are the advantages
and disadvantages of banking
organizations being required to
calculate risk-based capital ratios in two
different ways and what alternatives,
such as a single calculation, should the
agencies consider and why? What
modifications, if any, to the proposed
structure of the risk-based capital
calculation should the agencies
consider?
1. Standardized Output Floor
To enhance the consistency of capital
requirements and ensure that the use of
internal models for market risk does not
result in unwarranted reductions in
capital requirements, the proposal
would introduce an ‘‘output floor’’ to
the calculation of expanded total risk-
21The proposed methodology for determining
market risk-weighted assets, in certain instances,
would require a banking organization that is subject
to subpart E to apply risk weights from subpart D
for
purposes of determining its standardized total
risk-weighted assets and from subpart E for
purposes of determining its expanded total risk-
weighted assets. This approach would apply in the
case of: (i) capital add-ons for re-designations, (ii)
term repo-style transactions the banking
organization elects to include in market risk, (iii)
the standardized default risk capital requirement for
securitization positions non-CTP, and (iv) the
standardized default risk capital requirement for
correlation trading positions, each as discussed
further below.

weighted assets. This output floor
would correspond to 72.5 percent of the
sum of a banking organization’s credit
risk-weighted assets, equity risk-
weighted assets, operational risk-
weighted assets, and CVA risk-weighted
assets under the expanded risk-based
approach and risk-weighted assets
calculated using the standardized
measure for market risk, minus any
amount of the banking organization’s
adjusted allowance for credit losses that
is not included in tier 2 capital and any
amount of allocated transfer risk
reserves.
The output floor would serve as a
lower bound on the risk-weighted assets
under the expanded risk-based
approach. In other words, if the risk-
weighted assets under the expanded
risk-based approach were less than the
output floor, the output floor would
have to be used as the risk-weighted
asset amount to determine the expanded
risk-based approach capital ratios.
The proposed calibration of the
output floor aims to strike a balance
between allowing internal models to
enhance the risk sensitivity of market
risk capital requirements and ensuring
that these models would not result in
unwarranted reductions in capital
requirements. The output floor would
be consistent with the Basel III reforms,
which would promote consistency in
capital requirements for large, complex,
and internationally active banking
organizations across jurisdictions.
Question 6: What are the advantages
and disadvantages of the proposed
output floor?
2. Stress Capital Buffer Requirement
Under the current capital rule, each
banking organization is subject to one or
more buffer requirements, and must
maintain capital ratios above the sum of
its minimum requirements and buffer
requirements to avoid restrictions on
capital distributions and certain
discretionary bonus payments.22
Banking organizations that are subject to
the Board’s capital plan rule 23 (bank
holding companies, U.S. intermediate
holding companies, and savings and
loan holding companies that have over
$100 billion or more in total
consolidated assets) are currently
subject to a standardized approach
capital conservation buffer requirement,
which is calculated as the sum of the
banking organization’s stress capital
buffer requirement, applicable
countercyclical capital buffer
requirement, and applicable GSIB
surcharge. The standardized approach
capital conservation buffer requirement
applies to a banking organization’s
standardized approach risk-based
capital ratios. In addition, banking
organizations that are subject to the
capital plan rule and the advanced

CFR 324.11 (FDIC).

U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign
banking organizations); 12 CFR 238.170 (savings

approaches requirements are subject to
an advanced approaches capital
conservation buffer requirement, which
applies to their advanced approaches
risk-based capital ratios, and which is
calculated in the same manner as the
standardized approach capital
conservation buffer requirement, except
that the banking organization’s stress
capital buffer requirement is replaced
with a 2.5 percent buffer requirement.24
The stress capital buffer requirement
integrates the results of the Board’s
supervisory stress tests with the risk-
based requirements of the capital rule to
determine capital distribution
limitations. As a result, required capital
levels for each banking organization
more closely align with the banking
organization’s risk profile and projected
losses as measured by the Board’s stress
test.25 The stress capital buffer
requirement is generally calculated as
(1) the difference between the banking
organization’s starting and minimum
projected common equity tier 1 capital
ratios under the severely adverse
scenario in the supervisory stress test
(stress test losses) plus (2) the sum of
the dollar amount of the banking
organization’s planned common stock
dividends for each of the fourth through
seventh quarters of the planning horizon
as a percentage of risk-weighted assets
(dividend add-on).26 A banking
organization’s stress capital buffer

26 12 CFR 225.8(f)(2); 12 CFR 238.170(f)(2).
requirement cannot be less than 2.5
percent of standardized total risk-
weighted assets.
Currently, the stress test losses and
dividend add-on portion of the stress
capital buffer requirement are calculated
using only the standardized approach
common equity tier 1 capital ratio. This
is consistent with the exclusion of the
stress capital buffer requirement from
the advanced approaches capital
conservation buffer requirement, and
with the Board’s stress testing and
capital plan rules, under which banking
organizations are not required to project
capital ratios using the advanced
approaches.
The Board is proposing to amend its
capital plan rule, stress testing rule, and
the buffer framework in its capital rule
to take into account capital ratios
calculated under the expanded risk-
based approach, in addition to the
standardized approach. Under the
proposal, banking organizations subject
to the capital plan rule would be subject
to a single capital conservation buffer
requirement, which would include the
stress capital buffer requirement,
applicable countercyclical capital buffer
requirement, and applicable GSIB
surcharge, and would apply to the
banking organization’s risk-based
capital ratios, regardless of whether the
ratios result from the expanded risk-
based approach or the standardized
approach. In this manner, the proposal
would ensure that the stress capital
buffer requirement contributes to the
robustness and risk-sensitivity of the

risk-based capital requirements of these
banking organizations. Application of
the stress capital buffer requirement to
the risk-based capital ratios derived
from the expanded risk-based approach
would not introduce complexity given
the fixed balance sheet assumption
currently used in the Board stress tests
and because the expanded risk-based
approach is based in mostly
standardized requirements.27
Additionally, the proposal would
revise the calculation of the stress
capital buffer requirement for large
banking organizations. Under the
proposal, both the stress test losses and
dividend add-on components of the
stress capital buffer requirement would
be calculated using the binding common
equity tier 1 capital ratio, as of the final
quarter of the previous capital plan
cycle, regardless of whether it results
from the expanded risk-based approach
or the standardized approach.28 The
proposed calculation methodology
would limit complexity relative to
potential alternatives, such as
introducing two stress capital buffer
requirements for each banking
organization (one for each approach to
calculating total risk-weighted assets).
In addition, the proposed approach
recognizes that the binding approach for
a banking organization is unlikely to
change within the period in which a
given stress capital buffer requirement is
applicable.
As part of the capital buffer
framework, the stress capital buffer
requirement helps ensure that a banking
organization can withstand losses from
a severely adverse scenario, while still
meeting its minimum regulatory capital
requirements and thereby continuing to
serve as a viable financial intermediary.
Because this proposal aims to better
reflect the risk of banking organizations’
exposures in the calculation of risk-
weighted assets, without changing the
targeted level of conservatism of the
minimum capital requirements, the
Board is not proposing associated
27 Initially, the Board did not incorporate the
stress capital buffer requirement into the advanced
approaches capital conservation buffer requirement
owing to the complexity involved in doing so.
28The Board’s Stress Testing Policy Statement
includes an assumption that the magnitude of a
banking organization’s balance sheet will be fixed
throughout the projection horizon under the
supervisory stress test. 12 CFR part 252, appendix
B. Under this assumption, because the
denominators of the common equity tier 1 capital
ratios as calculated under the standardized
approach and the expanded risk-based approach
would remain the same throughout the stress test,
the approach under which the binding common
equity tier 1 capital ratio is calculated would
remain the same throughout the final quarter of the
previous capital plan cycle and the projection
horizon.
changes to the targeted severity of the
stress capital buffer requirement. The
Board evaluates the minimum risk-
based capital requirements, which are
largely determined by risk-weighted
assets, and the stress capital buffer
requirement individually for their
specific intended purposes in the
capital framework, and holistically as
they determine the aggregate capital
banking organizations hold in the
normal course of business.
In addition to revising the stress
capital buffer requirement, the proposal
would amend the Board’s stress testing
and capital plan rules to require banking
organizations subject to Category I, II, or
III standards to project their risk-based
capital ratios in their company-run
stress tests and capital plans using the
calculation approach that results in the
binding ratios as of the start of the
projection horizon (generally, as of
December 31 of a given year). Also, the
proposal would require banking
organizations subject to Category IV
standards to project their risk-based
capital ratios under baseline conditions
in their capital plans and FR Y–14A
submissions using the risk-weighted
assets calculation approach that results
in the binding ratios as of the start of the
projection horizon. The use of the
binding approach to calculating risk-
based capital ratios aims to conform
company-run stress tests and capital
plans with the binding risk-based
capital ratios in the proposed capital
rule and promote simplicity relative to
possible alternatives (such as requiring
that firms project ratios under both the
expanded risk-based approach and the
standardized approach).
Question 7: The Board invites
comment on the appropriate level of
risk capture for the risk-weighted assets
framework and the stress capital buffer
requirement, both for their respective
roles in the capital framework and for
their joint determination of overall
capital requirements. How should the
Board balance considerations of overall
capital requirements with the distinct
roles of minimum requirements and
buffer requirements? What adjustments,
if any, to either piece of the framework
should the Board consider? Which, if
any, specific portfolios or exposure
classes merit particular attention and
why?
Question 8: What are the advantages
and disadvantages of applying the same
stress capital buffer requirement to a
banking organization’s risk-based
capital ratios regardless of whether they
are determined using the standardized
or expanded risk-based approach? What
would be the advantages and
disadvantages of applying different
64035
stress capital buffer requirements for
each set of risk-based capital ratios?
Question 9: What, if any, adjustments
should the Board consider with respect
to the buffer requirements to account for
the transitions in this proposal,
particularly related to expanded total
risk-weighted assets? For example, what
would be the advantages and
disadvantages of the Board determining
stress capital buffer requirements using
fully phased-in expanded total risk-
weighted assets versus transitional
expanded total risk-weighted assets?
What, if any, additional adjustments to
stress capital buffer requirements
should the Board consider during the
expanded total risk-weighted assets
transition?
B. Definition of Capital
The agencies regularly review their
capital framework to help ensure it is
functioning as intended. Consistent
with this ongoing assessment, the
agencies believe it is appropriate to
align the definition of capital for
banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards with
the definition currently applicable to
banking organizations subject to
Category I or II capital standards. The
current definition of capital applicable
to banking organizations subject to
Category I or II capital standards
provides for risk sensitivity and
transparency that is commensurate with
the size, complexity, and risk profile of
banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards. The
proposed alignment of the numerator
and denominator of regulatory capital
ratios of large banking organizations
would support the transparency of the
capital rule as it facilitates market
participants’ assessment of loss
absorbency and would promote
consistency of requirements across large
banking organizations.
As described in more detail below,
under the proposal, banking
organizations subject to Category III or
IV capital standards would be required
to recognize most elements of AOCI in
regulatory capital consistent with the
treatment for banking organizations
subject to Category I or II capital
standards. Banking organizations
subject to Category III or IV capital
standards would also apply the capital
deductions and minority interest
treatments that are currently applicable
to banking organizations subject to
Category I or II capital standards. The
proposal would also apply total loss
absorbing capacity (TLAC) holdings
deduction treatments to banking
organizations subject to Category III or

banking organizations subject to

other banking organizations including

to make a one-time election to opt-out
of recognizing most elements of AOCI
and related deferred tax assets (DTAs)
and deferred tax liabilities within
regulatory capital (AOCI opt-out
banking organizations).29 Under the
proposal, consistent with the treatment
applicable to banking organizations
subject to Category I or II capital
standards, banking organizations subject
to Category III or IV capital standards
would be required to include all AOCI
components in common equity tier 1
capital, except gains and losses on cash-
flow hedges where the hedged item is
not recognized on a banking
organization’s balance sheet at fair
value. This would require all net
unrealized holding gains and losses on
available-for-sale (AFS) debt
securities 30 from changes in fair value
to flow through to common equity tier
1 capital, including those that result
primarily from fluctuations in
benchmark interest rates. This treatment
would better reflect the point in time

organizations subject to Category III or

losses on available-for-sale securities; subtract any
accumulated net gains and add any accumulated
net losses on cash flow hedges; subtract any
amounts recorded in AOCI attributed to defined

initial and subsequent application of the relevant
GAAP standards that pertain to such plans
(excluding, at the banking organization’s option, the
portion relating to pension assets deducted under
§ll.22(a)(5) of the current capital rule); and,
subtract any net unrealized holding gains and add
any net unrealized holding losses on held-to-
maturity securities that are included in AOCI.
30AFS securities refers to debt securities. ASC
Subtopic 321–10 eliminated the classification of
equity securities with readily determinable fair
values not held for trading as available-for-sale and
generally requires investments in equity securities
to be measured at fair value with changes in fair
value recognized in net income. Changes in the fair
value of (i.e., the unrealized gains and losses on) a
banking organization’s equity securities are
recognized through net income rather than other
comprehensive income.
with banking organizations subject to
Category I or II capital standards.
The agencies have previously
observed that the requirement to
recognize elements of AOCI in
regulatory capital has helped improve
the transparency of regulatory capital
ratios, as it better reflects banking
organizations’ actual loss-absorbing
capacity at a specific point in time,
notwithstanding the potential volatility
that such recognition may pose for their
regulatory capital ratios. The agencies
have also previously observed that
AOCI is an important indicator used by
market participants to evaluate the
capital strength of a banking
organization.31 More recently, the
agencies have observed generally higher
levels of securities classified as held-to-
maturity (HTM) among banking
organizations that recognize AOCI in
regulatory capital.32
Changes in interest rates have led to
net unrealized losses for banking
organizations’ investment portfolios and
brought into focus the importance of
regulatory capital measures reflecting
the loss absorbing capacity of a banking
organization. The agencies have
observed that adverse trends in a
banking organization’s GAAP equity can
have negative market perception and
liquidity implications.33 Specifically,
net unrealized losses on AFS securities
included in AOCI have reduced banking
organizations’ tangible book value and
liquidity buffers,34 which can adversely
affect market participants’ assessments
of capital adequacy and liquidity.
Banking organizations are often
reluctant to sell these AFS securities as
the unrealized losses would become
realized losses upon sale, thus reducing
regulatory capital. However, banking
organizations may need to take such
steps in order to meet liquidity needs.
Recognizing elements of AOCI in
regulatory capital thus achieves a better
alignment of regulatory capital with
market participants’ assessment of loss-
absorbing capacity.

32 GAAP set forth restrictions on the classification
of a debt security as HTM, circumstances not
consistent with the HTM classification, and
situations that call into question or taint a banking
organization’s intent to hold securities in the HTM
category.

Question 10: What complementary
measures should the banking agencies
consider regarding the regulatory
capital treatment for securities held as
HTM rather than AFS?
2. Regulatory Capital Deductions
The agencies have long limited the
amount of intangible and higher-risk
assets, such as mortgage servicing assets
(MSAs) and certain temporary
difference DTAs, included in regulatory
capital and required deduction of the
amounts above the limits. This is due to
the relatively high level of uncertainty
regarding the ability of banking
organizations to both accurately value
and realize value from these assets,
especially under adverse financial
conditions. The current capital rule also
limits the amount of investments in the
capital instruments of other banking
organizations that can be reflected in
regulatory capital. Furthermore, the
current capital rule limits the inclusion
of minority interest 35 in regulatory
capital in recognition that minority
interest is generally not available to
absorb losses at the banking
organization’s consolidated level and to
prevent highly capitalized subsidiaries
from overstating the amount of capital
available to absorb losses at the
consolidated organization.
Under the current capital rule,
banking organizations subject to
Category I or II capital standards must
deduct from common equity tier 1
capital amounts of MSAs, temporary
difference DTAs that the banking
organization could not realize through
net operating loss carrybacks, and
significant investments in the capital of
unconsolidated financial institutions in
the form of common stock 36
(collectively, threshold items) that
individually exceed 10 percent of the
banking organization’s common equity
tier 1 capital minus certain deductions
and adjustments.37 Banking
organizations subject to Category I or II
capital standards must also deduct from
common equity tier 1 capital the
aggregate amount of threshold items not
deducted under the 10 percent
. 
35 Minority interest, also referred to as non-
controlling interest, reflects investments in the
capital instruments of subsidiaries of banking
organizations that are held by third parties.
36A significant investment in the capital of an
unconsolidated financial institution is defined as an
investment in the capital of an unconsolidated
financial institution where a banking organization
subject to Category I or II capital standards owns
more than 10 percent of the issued and outstanding
common stock of the unconsolidated financial
institution. 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2
(Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).

threshold deduction but that
nevertheless exceeds 15 percent of the
banking organization’s common equity
tier 1 capital minus certain deductions
and adjustments. Under the current
capital rule, banking organizations
subject to Category III or IV capital
standards are required to deduct from
common equity tier 1 capital any
amount of MSAs, temporary difference
DTAs that the banking organization
could not realize through net operating
loss carrybacks, and investments in the
capital of unconsolidated financial
institutions 38 that individually exceed
25 percent of common equity tier 1
capital of the banking organization
minus certain deductions and
adjustments.
Under the proposal, banking
organizations subject to Category III or
IV capital standards would be required
to deduct threshold items from common
equity tier 1 capital and apply other
capital deductions that are currently
applicable to banking organizations
subject to Category I or II capital
standards instead of the deductions
applicable to all other banking
organizations, thereby creating
alignment across all banking
organizations subject to the proposal.
In addition to deductions for the
threshold items, the current capital rule
requires that a banking organization
subject to Category I or II capital
standards deduct from regulatory capital
any amount of the banking
organization’s nonsignificant
investments 39 in the capital of
unconsolidated financial institutions
that exceeds 10 percent of the banking
organization’s common equity tier 1
capital minus certain deductions and
adjustments.40 Further, significant
investments in the capital of
unconsolidated financial institutions
not in the form of common stock must
be deducted from regulatory capital in
their entirety.41 Under the proposal,
38For banking organizations that are not subject
to Category I or II capital standards, the current
capital rule does not have distinct treatments for
significant and nonsignificant investments in the
capital of unconsolidated financial institutions.
Rather, the regulatory capital treatment for an
investment in the capital of unconsolidated
financial institutions would be based on the type
of instrument underlying the investment.
39A non-significant investment in the capital of
an unconsolidated financial institution is defined as
an investment in the capital of an unconsolidated
financial institution where a banking organization
subject to Category I or II capital standards owns 10
percent or less of the issued and outstanding
common stock of the unconsolidated financial
institution. 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2

banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards
would be required to make these
deductions.
Similar to the deductions for
investments in the capital of
unconsolidated financial institutions,
the current capital rule requires banking
organizations subject to Category I or II
capital standards to deduct covered debt
instruments from regulatory capital.42
Under the proposal, banking
organizations subject to Category III or
IV capital standards would be required
to apply the deduction requirements for
certain investments in unsecured debt
instruments issued by U.S. or foreign
GSIBs (covered debt instruments) that
currently apply to banking organizations
subject to Category I or II capital
standards.43 The current capital rule
generally treats investments in
unsecured debt instruments issued by
U.S. or foreign GSIBs as tier 2 capital
instruments for purposes of applying
deduction requirements.
The current capital rule also limits the
amount of minority interest that banking
organizations subject to Category I or II
capital standards may include in
regulatory capital based on the amount
of capital held by a consolidated
subsidiary, relative to the amount of
capital the subsidiary would have had
to maintain to avoid any restrictions on
capital distributions and discretionary
bonus payments under capital
conservation buffer requirements.44
Under the current capital rule, banking
organizations subject to Category III or
IV capital standards are allowed to
include: (i) common equity tier 1
minority interest comprising up to 10
percent of the parent banking
organization’s common equity tier 1
capital; (ii) tier 1 minority interest
comprising up to 10 percent of the
parent banking organization’s tier 1
capital; and (iii) total capital minority
interest comprising up to 10 percent of
the parent banking organization’s total
capital.45 Under the proposal, the
limitations on minority interests that
apply to banking organizations subject
to Category I or II capital standards
would also apply to banking

Category II capital standards, the definition of
excluded covered debt and the applicable capital
treatment, would not apply to banking
organizations subject to Category III and IV capital
standards. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2)

organizations subject to Category III or
IV capital standards.
3. Additional Definition of Capital
Adjustments
The current capital rule applies an
additional capital eligibility criterion to
banking organizations subject to
Category I or II capital standards for
their additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital
instruments. The criterion requires that
the governing agreement, offering
circular or prospectus for the instrument
must disclose that the holders of the
instrument may be fully subordinated to
interests held by the U.S. government in
the event the banking organization
enters into a receivership, insolvency,
liquidation, or similar proceeding.
Under the proposal, this eligibility
criterion would also apply to
instruments issued after the date on
which the issuer becomes subject to the
proposed rule, which generally would
be the effective date of a final rule for
banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards.
Instruments issued by banking
organizations subject to Category III or
IV capital standards prior to the
effective date of a final rule that
currently count as regulatory capital
would continue to count as regulatory
capital as long as those instruments
remain outstanding.
4. Changes to the Definition of Tier 2
Capital Applicable to Large Banking
Organizations
The current capital rule defines an
element of tier 2 capital to include the
allowance for loan and lease losses
(ALLL) or the adjusted allowance for
credit losses (AACL), as applicable, up
to 1.25 percent of standardized total
risk-weighted assets not including any
amount of the ALLL or AACL, as
applicable (and excluding in the case of
a banking organization subject to market
risk requirements, its standardized
market risk-weighted assets). Further, as
part
of its calculations for determining
its total capital ratio, a banking
organization subject to Category I or II
standards must determine its advanced-
approaches-adjusted total capital by (1)
deducting from its total capital any
ALLL or AACL, as applicable, included
in its tier 2 capital and; (2) adding to its
total capital any eligible credit reserves
that exceed the banking organization’s
total expected credit losses to the extent
that the excess reserve amount does not
exceed 0.6 percent of credit-risk-
weighted assets. Due to changes in
GAAP, all large banking organizations
are no longer using ALLL and must use
AACL. In addition, the concept of
eligible credit reserves is related to use

of the internal ratings-based approach,
which the proposal would eliminate.
Therefore, under the proposal, a large
banking organization would determine
its expanded risk-based approach-
adjusted total capital by (1) deducting
from its total capital AACL included in
its tier 2 capital and; (2) adding to its
total capital any AACL up to 1.25
percent of total credit risk-weighted
assets. The proposal would define total
credit risk-weighted assets as the sum of
total risk-weighted assets for: (1) general
credit risk as calculated under
§ .110; (2) cleared transactions and
default fund contributions as calculated
under §ll.114; (3) unsettled
transactions as calculated under
§ .115; and (4) securitization
exposures as calculated under
§ ll.132.
Question 11: The agencies seek
comment on the proposed definition of
total credit risk-weighted assets in
connection with determining a banking
organization’s total capital ratio. What,
if any, modifications should the
agencies consider making to this
definition and why?
C. Credit Risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility
that an obligor, including a borrower or
counterparty, will fail to perform on an
obligation. While loans are a significant
source of credit risk, other products,
activities, and services also expose
banking organizations to credit risk,
including investments in debt securities
and other credit instruments, credit
derivatives, and cash management
services. Off-balance sheet activities,
such as letters of credit, unfunded loan
commitments, and the undrawn portion
of lines of credit, also expose banking
organizations to credit risk.
In this section of the SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION, subsection III.C.1.
describes expectations for completing
due diligence on a banking
organization’s credit risk portfolio;
subsection III.C.2. describes the risk-
weight treatment for on-balance sheet
exposures under the proposal;
subsection III.C.3. describes the
proposed approach to determine the
exposure amount for off-balance sheet
exposures; and subsections III.C.4.–5
provide the available approaches for
recognizing the benefits of credit risk
mitigants including certain guarantees,
certain credit derivatives and financial
collateral.
1. Due Diligence
Banking organizations must maintain
capital commensurate with the level
and nature of the risks to which they are
exposed.46 The agencies’ safety and
soundness guidelines establish
standards for banking organizations to
have an adequate understanding of the
impact of their lending decisions on the
banking organization’s credit risk.47 A
banking organization’s performance of
due diligence on their credit portfolios
is central to meeting both of these
obligations. For example, under the
safety and soundness guidelines, a
banking organization is expected to
have established effective internal
policies, processes, systems, and
controls to ensure that the banking
organization’s regulatory reporting is
accurate and reflects appropriate risk
weights assigned to credit exposures.48
When properly performed, due
diligence may lead a banking
organization to conclude that the
minimum regulatory capital
requirements for certain exposures do
not sufficiently account for their
potential credit risk. In such instances,
the banking organization should take
appropriate risk mitigating measures
such as allocating additional capital,
establishing larger credit loss
allowances, or requiring additional
collateral. Adherence to due diligence
standards, as established through the
agencies’ safety and soundness
guidelines, directly supports and
facilitates requirements for banking
organizations to maintain capital
commensurate with the level and nature
of the risks to which they are exposed.
Question 12: The agencies seek
comment on whether due diligence
requirements should be directly
integrated into the text of the final rule.
What would be the advantages and
disadvantages of specifying increases in
risk weights that would be required to
the extent that due diligence
requirements are not met, similar to the
proposed risk-weight treatment for
securitization exposures as described in
section III.D of this SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION?
2. Proposed Risk Weights for Credit Risk
The proposal would replace the use of
internal models to set regulatory capital
requirements for credit risk as set out in
subpart E of the current capital rule
with a new expanded risk-based
approach for credit risk applicable to
46See 12 CFR 3.10(e) (OCC); 12 CFR 217.10(e)

organizations must adhere to the operational and

Soundness (safety and soundness guidelines).
.
large banking organizations. The
proposed expanded risk-based approach
for credit risk would retain many of the
same definitions § ll.2 of the current
capital rule including among others a
sovereign, a sovereign exposure, certain
supranational entities, a multilateral
development bank, a public sector
entity (PSE), a government-sponsored
enterprise (GSE), other assets, and a
commitment. Some elements of the
proposed expanded risk-based approach
for credit risk would apply the same
risk-weight treatment provided in
subpart D of the current capital rule
(current standardized approach) for on-
balance sheet exposures, including
exposures to sovereigns, certain
supranational entities and multilateral
development banks, government
sponsored entities (GSEs) in the form of
senior debt and guaranteed exposures,
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and
Federal Agricultural Mortgage
Corporation (Farmer Mac) equity
exposures,49 public sector entities
(PSEs), and other assets. The proposal
would also apply the same risk-weight
treatment provided in the current
standardized approach to the following
real estate exposures: pre-sold
construction loans, statutory
multifamily mortgages, and high-
volatility commercial real estate
(HVCRE) exposures.
Relative to the internal models-based
approaches in the advanced approaches
under the current capital rule, the
proposed expanded risk-based approach
would result in more transparent capital
requirements for credit risk exposures
across banking organizations. The
proposal would also facilitate
comparisons of capital adequacy across
banking organizations by reducing
excessive, unwarranted variability in
risk-weighted assets for similar
exposures. Relative to the current
standardized approach, the proposal
would incorporate more granular risk
factors to allow for a broader range of
risk weights.
Specifically, the proposal would
introduce the expanded risk-based
approach for exposures to depository
institutions, foreign banks, and credit
unions; exposures to subordinated debt
instruments, including those to GSEs;
and real estate, retail, and corporate
exposures. The proposal would also
increase risk capture for certain off-
balance sheet exposures through a new
exposure methodology for commitments
without pre-set limits and would

modify the credit conversion factors
applicable to commitments.
Additionally, the proposal would
introduce new definitions for defaulted
exposures and defaulted real estate
exposures.
Under the proposal, a banking
organization would determine the risk-
weighted asset amount for an on-
balance sheet exposure by multiplying
the exposure amount by the applicable
risk weight, consistent with the method
used under the current standardized
approach. The on-balance sheet
exposure amount would generally be
the banking organization’s carrying
value 50 of the exposure, consistent with
the value of the asset on the balance
sheet as determined in accordance with
GAAP, which is the same as under the
current capital rule. For all assets other
than AFS securities and purchased
credit-deteriorated assets, the carrying
value is not reduced by any associated
credit loss allowance that is determined
in accordance with GAAP. Using the
value of an asset under GAAP to
determine a banking organization’s
exposure amount would reduce burden
and provide a consistent framework that
can be easily applied across all banking
organizations of the proposal because,
in most cases, GAAP serve as the basis
for the information presented in
financial statements and regulatory
reports.51
The proposal would group credit risk
exposures into the following categories:
sovereign exposures; exposures to
certain supranational entities and
multilateral development banks;
exposures to GSEs; exposures to
depository institutions, foreign banks,
and credit unions; exposures to PSEs;
real estate exposures; retail exposures;
corporate exposures; defaulted
exposures; exposures to subordinated
debt instruments; and off-balance sheet
exposures.
The proposed categories with
amended risk-weight treatments relative
to the current standardized approach
. 
50Carrying value under §ll. 2 of the current
capital rule means, with respect to an asset, the
value of the asset on the balance sheet of the
banking organization as determined in accordance
with GAAP. For all assets other than available-for-
sale debt securities or purchased credit deteriorated
assets, the carrying value is not reduced by any
associated credit loss allowance that is determined
in accordance with GAAP. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC);
12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC). The
exposure amount arising from an OTC derivative
contract; a repo-style transaction or an eligible
margin loan; a cleared transaction; a default fund
contribution; or a securitization exposure would be
calculated in accordance with §§ll.113, 121, or
131 of the proposal, respectively, as described in
sections III.C.4, II.C.5.b., and III.D. of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.
51See 12 U.S.C. 1831n.
include equity exposures to GSEs and
exposures to subordinated debt
instruments issued by GSEs; exposures
to depository institutions, foreign banks,
and credit unions; exposures to
subordinated debt instruments; real
estate exposures; retail exposures;
corporate exposures; defaulted
exposures; and some off-balance sheet
exposures such as commitments. The
proposed risk weight treatments for
each of these categories are described in
the following sections of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.
a. Defaulted Exposures
The proposal would introduce an
enhanced definition of a defaulted
exposure that would be broader than the
current capital rule’s definition of a
defaulted exposure under subpart E.
The proposed scope and criteria of the
defaulted exposure category is intended
to appropriately capture the elevated
credit risk of exposures where the
banking organization’s reasonable
expectation of repayment has been
reduced, including exposures where the
obligor is in default on an unrelated
obligation. Under the proposal, a
defaulted exposure would be any
exposure that is a credit obligation and
that meets the proposed criteria related
to reduced expectation of repayment,
and that is not an exposure to a
sovereign entity,52 a real estate
exposure,53 or a policy loan.54 The
proposal would define a credit
obligation as any exposure where the
lender but not the obligor is exposed to
credit risk. In other words, for these
exposures, the lender would have a
claim on the obligor that does not give
rise to counterparty credit risk 55 and
52Under the proposal, the expanded risk-based
approach would rely on the treatment of sovereign
default in the current standardized approach in the
capital rule. See 12 CFR 3.32(a)(6) (OCC); 12 CFR
217.32(a)(6) (Board); 12 CFR 324.32 (a)(6) (FDIC).
53For the treatment of defaulted real estate
exposures, see section III.C.2.e.vii of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.
54A policy loan is defined under §.2 of the
current capital rule to mean means a loan by an
insurance company to a policy holder pursuant to
the provisions of an insurance contract that is
secured by the cash surrender value or collateral
assignment of the related policy or contract. A
policy loan includes: (1) A cash loan, including a
loan resulting from early payment benefits or
accelerated payment benefits, on an insurance
contract when the terms of contract specify that the
payment is a policy loan secured by the policy; and
(2) An automatic premium loan, which is a loan
that is made in accordance with policy provisions
which provide that delinquent premium payments
are automatically paid from the cash value at the
end of the established grace period for premium
payments. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2
(Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
55Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the
counterparty to a transaction could default before
the final settlement of the transaction where there
is a bilateral risk of loss.
64039
would exclude derivative contracts,
cleared transactions, default fund
contributions, repo-style transactions,
eligible margin loans, equity exposures,
and securitization exposures.
For all other exposure categories
(excluding an exposure to a sovereign
entity, real estate exposure, a retail
exposure, or a policy loan), the
proposed definition of defaulted
exposure would look to the performance
of the borrower with respect to credit
obligations to any creditor. Specifically,
if the banking organization determines
that an obligor meets any of the of the
defaulted criteria for exposures that are
not retail exposures, described further
below, the proposal would require the
banking organization to treat all
exposures that are credit obligations of
that obligor as defaulted exposures.
Additionally, the proposal would
differentiate the criteria for determining
whether an exposure is a defaulted
exposure between exposures that are
retail exposures and those that are not.
Retail exposures are originated to
individuals or small- and medium-sized
businesses. Evaluating whether a retail
borrower has other exposures that are in
default as defined by the proposal may
be difficult to operationalize for banking
organizations given many unique
obligors. For other types of exposures
that are not retail exposures, evaluating
default at the obligor level is
appropriate because those obligors are
more likely to have additional credit
obligations that are large and held by
multiple banking organizations. Default
on one of those credit obligations would
be indicative of increased riskiness of
the
exposure held by a banking
organization, and hence a banking
organization should account for this in
evaluating the risk profile of the
borrower.
Under the proposal, for a retail
exposure, a credit obligation would be
considered a defaulted exposure if any
of the following has occurred: (1) the
exposure is 90 days past due or in
nonaccrual status; (2) the banking
organization has taken a partial charge-
off, write-down of principal, or negative
fair value adjustment on the exposure
for credit-related reasons, until the
banking organization has reasonable
assurance of repayment and
performance for all contractual
principal and interest payments on the
exposure; or (3) a distressed
restructuring of the exposure was agreed
to by the banking organization, until the
banking organization has reasonable
assurance of repayment and
performance for all contractual
principal and interest payments on the
exposure as demonstrated by a

extension, or an interest rate reduction.
A sustained period of repayment
performance by the borrower is
generally a minimum of six months in
accordance with the contractual terms
of the restructured exposure.
For exposures that are not retail
exposures (excluding an exposure to a
sovereign entity, a real estate exposure,
or a policy loan), a credit obligation
would be considered a defaulted
exposure if either of the following has
occurred: (1) the obligor has a credit
obligation to the banking organization
that is 90 days or more past due 56 or in
nonaccrual status; or (2) the banking
organization determines that, based on
ongoing credit monitoring, the obligor is
unlikely to pay its credit obligations to
the banking organization in full, without
recourse by the banking organization. If
a banking organization determines that
an obligor meets these proposed criteria,
the proposal would require the banking
organization to treat all exposures that
are credit obligations of that obligor as
defaulted exposures.
For purposes of the second criterion,
the proposal would require a banking
organization to consider an obligor as
unlikely to pay its credit obligations if
any of the following criteria apply: (1)
the obligor has any credit obligation that
is 90 days or more past due or in
nonaccrual status with any creditor; (2)
any credit obligation of the obligor has
been sold at a credit-related loss; (3) a
distressed restructuring of any credit
obligation of the obligor was agreed to
by any creditor, provided that a
distressed restructuring includes the
following made for credit-related
reasons: forgiveness or postponement of
principal, interest, or fees, term
extension or an interest rate reduction;
(4) the obligor is subject to a pending or
active bankruptcy proceeding; or (5) any
creditor has taken a full or partial
charge-off, write-down of principal, or
negative fair value adjustment on a
credit obligation of the obligor for
credit-related reasons. Under the
proposal, banking organizations are
expected to conduct ongoing credit
monitoring regarding relevant obligors.
The proposal would require banking
organizations to continue to treat an
exposure as a defaulted exposure until
56Overdrafts are past due and are considered
defaulted exposures once the obligor has breached
an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller
than the current outstanding balance.
the exposure no longer meets the
definition or until the banking
organization determines that the obligor
meets the definition of investment
grade 57 or the proposed definition of
speculative grade.58 The proposal
would revise the definition of
speculative grade, consistent with the
current definition of investment grade,
to allow the definition to apply to
entities to which the banking
organization is exposed through a loan
or security. In addition, the proposal
would make the same revision to the
definition of sub-speculative grade.
A banking organization would assign
a 150 percent risk weight to a defaulted
exposure including any exposure
amount remaining on the balance sheet
following a charge-off, and any other
non-retail exposure to the same obligor,
to reflect the increased uncertainty as to
the recovery of the remaining carrying
value. The proposed risk weight is
intended to reflect the impaired credit
quality of defaulted exposures and to
help ensure that banking organizations
maintain sufficient regulatory capital for
the increased probability of losses on
these exposures. A banking organization
may apply a risk weight to the
guaranteed or secured portion of a
defaulted exposure based on (1) the risk
weight under § ll.120 of the proposal
if the guarantee or credit derivative
meets the applicable requirements or (2)
the risk weight under §ll.121 of the
proposal if the collateral meets the
applicable requirements.
Question 13: How does the defaulted
exposure definition compare with
banking organizations’ existing policies
relating to the determination of the
credit risk of a defaulted exposure and
the creditworthiness of a defaulted
obligor? What additional clarifications
are necessary to determine the point at
which retail and non-retail exposures
should no longer be treated as defaulted
exposures?
57Under §ll.2 of the current capital rule,
investment grade means that the entity to which the
banking organization is exposed through a loan or
security, or the reference entity with respect to a
credit derivative, has adequate capacity to meet
financial commitments for the projected life of the
asset or exposure. Such an entity or reference entity
has adequate capacity to meet financial
commitments if the risk of its default is low and the
full and timely repayment of principal and interest
is expected. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2
(Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
58The proposal would revise the definition of
speculative grade to mean that the entity to which
a banking organization is exposed through a loan
or security, or the reference entity with respect to
a credit derivative, has adequate capacity to meet
financial commitments in the near term, but is
vulnerable to adverse economic conditions, such
that should economic conditions deteriorate, the
issuer or the reference entity would present an
elevated default risk.
.
Question 14: What operational
challenges, if any, would a banking
organization face in identifying which
exposures meet the proposed definition
of defaulted exposure? In particular, the
agencies seek comment on the ability of
a banking organization to obtain the
necessary information to assess whether
the credit obligations of a borrower to
creditors other than the banking
organization would meet the proposed
criteria? What operational challenges, if
any, would a banking organization face
in identifying whether obligors on non-
retail credit obligations are subject to a
pending or active bankruptcy
proceeding?
Question 15: For the purposes of retail
credit obligations, the agencies invite
comment on the appropriateness of
including a borrower’s bankruptcy as a
criterion for a defaulted exposure. What
operational challenges, if any, would a
banking organization face in identifying
whether obligors on retail credit
obligations are subject to a pending or
active bankruptcy proceeding? To what
extent would criteria (1) through (3) in
the proposed defaulted exposure
definition for retail exposures
sufficiently capture the risk of a
borrower involved in a bankruptcy
proceeding?
Question 16: What alternatives to the
proposed treatment should the agencies
consider while maintaining a risk-
sensitive treatment for credit risk of a
defaulted borrower? For example, what
would be the advantages and
disadvantages of limiting the defaulted
borrower scope to obligations of the
borrower with the banking organization?
b. Exposures to Government-Sponsored
Enterprises
The proposal would assign a 20
percent risk weight to GSE 59 exposures
that are not equity exposures,
securitization exposures or exposures to
a subordinated debt instrument issued
by a GSE, consistent with the current
standardized approach.60 Under the
proposal, an exposure to the common
stock issued by a GSE would be an
59 Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) under
§ll. 2 of the current capital rule means an entity
established or chartered by the U.S. government to
serve public purposes specified by the U.S.
Congress but whose debt obligations are not
explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of
the U.S. government. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR
217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
60Similar to the treatment of senior debt
exposures to GSEs and GSE exposures that are not
equity exposures or exposures to a subordinated
debt instrument issued by a GSE, the proposal
would apply the same 20 percent risk weight to all
exposures to FHLB or Farmer Mac, including equity
exposures and exposures to subordinated debt
instruments, which continues the treatment under
the current standardized approach.

equity exposure. An exposure to the
preferred stock issued by a GSE would
be an equity exposure or an exposure to
a subordinated debt instrument,
depending on the contractual terms of
the preferred stock instrument. Equity
exposures to a GSE must be assigned a
risk-weighted asset amount as
calculated under §§ ll.140 through
.142 of subpart E. An exposure to a
subordinated debt instrument issued by
a GSE must be assigned a 150 percent
risk weight, unless issued by a FHLB or
Farmer Mac. As discussed later in
sections III.E. and III.C.2.d. of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, equity
exposures and exposures to
subordinated debt instruments would
generally be subject to an increased risk-
based capital requirement to reflect their
heightened risk relative to exposures to
senior debt.
c. Exposures to Depository Institutions,
Foreign Banks, and Credit Unions
The proposal would define the scope
of exposures to depository institutions,
foreign banks, and credit unions in a
manner that is consistent with the
definitions and scope of exposures
covered under the current capital rule.
Under the proposal, a bank exposure
would mean an exposure (such as a
receivable, guarantee, letter of credit,
loan, OTC derivative contract, or senior
debt instrument) to any depository
institution, foreign bank, or credit
union.61
The proposed treatment for bank
exposures supports the simplicity,
transparency, and consistency
objectives of the proposal in a manner
that is appropriately risk sensitive. The
proposal would provide three categories
for bank exposures that are ranked from
the highest to the lowest in terms of
creditworthiness: Grade A, Grade B, and
Grade C. The assignment of the bank
exposure category would be based on
the obligor depository institution,
foreign bank, or credit union. As
outlined below, the proposal would rely
on the current capital rule’s definition
of investment grade and the proposed
definition of speculative grade for
. 
61Under §ll.2 of the current capital rule, a
depository institution means a depository
institution as defined in section 3 of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act, a foreign bank means a
foreign bank as defined in section 211.2 of the
Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K (12 CFR
211.2) (other than a depository institution), and a
credit union means an insured credit union as
defined under the Federal Credit Union Act (12
U.S.C. 1751 et seq.). See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR
217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC). Exposures to
other financial institutions, such as bank holding
companies, savings and loans holding companies,
and securities firms, generally would be considered
corporate exposures. See 78 FR 62087 (October 11,
2013).
differentiating the credit risk of bank
exposures. In addition, the proposal
would incorporate publicly disclosed
capital levels to differentiate the
financial strength of a depository
institution, foreign bank, or credit union
in a manner that is both objective and
transparent to supervisors and the
public.
More specifically, a Grade A bank
exposure would mean a bank exposure
for which the obligor depository
institution, foreign bank, or credit union
(1) is investment grade, and (2) whose
most recent publicly disclosed capital
ratios meet or exceed the higher of: (a)
the minimum capital requirements and
any
additional amounts necessary to not
be subject to limitations on distributions
and discretionary bonus payments
under the capital rules established by
the prudential supervisor of the
depository institution, foreign bank, or
credit union, and (b) if applicable, the
capital ratio requirements for the well-
capitalized category under the agencies’
prompt corrective action framework,62
or under similar rules of the National
Credit Union Administration.63 For
example, an exposure to an investment
grade depository institution could
qualify as a Grade A bank exposure if
the depository institution was not
subject to limitations on distributions
and discretionary bonus payments
under the capital rules and had risk-
based capital ratios that met the well
capitalized thresholds under the
agencies’ prompt corrective action
framework. Further, a bank exposure to
a depository institution that had opted
into the community bank leverage ratio
(CBLR) framework and is investment
grade would be considered to be a Grade
A bank exposure, even if the obligor
depository institution were in the grace
period under the CBLR framework.64
Under the proposal, a depository
institution that uses the CBLR
framework would not be required to
calculate or disclose risk-based capital
ratios for purposes of qualifying as a
Grade A bank exposure.
A Grade B bank exposure would mean
a bank exposure that is not a Grade A
bank exposure and for which the obligor
depository institution, foreign bank, or
credit union (1) is speculative grade or
investment grade, and (2) whose most
recent publicly disclosed capital ratios
meet or exceed the higher of: (a) the

recent quarterly Consolidated Report of Condition
and Income (Call Report).

Administration).

applicable minimum capital
requirements under capital rules
established by the prudential supervisor
of the depository institution, foreign
bank, or credit union, and (b) if
applicable, the capital ratio
requirements for the adequately-
capitalized category 65 under the
agencies’ prompt corrective action
framework,66 or under similar rules of
the National Credit Union
Administration.67
For a foreign bank to qualify as a
Grade A or Grade B bank exposure, the
proposal would require the applicable
capital standards imposed by the home
country supervisor to be consistent with
international capital standards issued by
the Basel Committee.
A Grade C bank exposure would mean
a bank exposure that does not qualify as
a Grade A or Grade B bank exposure.
For example, a bank exposure would be
a Grade C bank exposure if the obligor
depository institution, foreign bank, or
credit union has not publicly disclosed
its capital ratios within the last six
months. In addition, an exposure would
be a Grade C bank exposure if the
external auditor of the depository
institution, foreign bank, or credit union
has issued an adverse audit opinion or
has expressed substantial doubt about
the ability of the depository institution,
foreign bank, or credit union to continue
as a going concern within the previous
12 months.
Under the proposal, a foreign bank
exposure that is a Grade A or Grade B
bank exposure and is a self-liquidating,
trade-related contingent item that arises
from the movement of goods and that
has a maturity of three months or less
may be assigned a risk weight that is
lower than the risk weight applicable to
other exposures to the same foreign
bank. The proposed approach to
providing a preferential risk weight for
short-term self-liquidating, trade-related
contingent items would be consistent
with the current standardized approach.
The proposal would also address the
risk that capital and foreign exchange
controls imposed by a sovereign entity
in which a foreign bank is located could
prevent or materially impede the ability
of the foreign bank to convert its
currency to meet its obligations or
transfer funds. The proposal would,
therefore, provide a risk weight floor for
foreign bank exposures based on the risk
weight applicable to a sovereign

d. Subordinated Debt Instruments
The proposal would introduce a
definition and an explicit risk weight
treatment for exposures in the form of
subordinated debt instruments. The
proposed definition of a subordinated
debt instrument would capture
exposures that are financial instruments
and present heightened credit risk but
are not equity exposures, including: (1)
any preferred stock that does not meet
the definition of an equity exposure, (2)
any
covered debt instrument, including
a TLAC debt instrument, that is not
deducted from regulatory capital, and
(3) any debt instrument that qualifies as
tier 2 capital under the current capital
rule or that would otherwise be treated
as regulatory capital by the primary
Federal supervisor of the issuer and that
is not deducted from regulatory capital.
external debt. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2
(Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC). For more information
on the OECD country risk classification
methodology, see OECD, ‘‘Country Risk
Classification,’’ available at https://www.oecd.org/
trade/topics/export-credits/arrangement-and-
sector-understandings/financing-terms-and-
conditions/country-risk-classification/.
70The CRCs reflect an assessment of country risk,
used to set interest rate charges for transactions
The proposal would define a
subordinated debt instrument as (1) a
debt security that is a corporate
exposure, a bank exposure, or an
exposure to a GSE, including a note,
bond, debenture, similar instrument, or
other debt instrument as determined by
the primary Federal supervisor, that is
subordinated by its terms, or separate
intercreditor agreement, to any creditor
of the obligor, or (2) preferred stock that
is not an equity exposure. For these
purposes, a debt security would be
subordinated if the documentation
creating or evidencing such
indebtedness (or a separate intercreditor
agreement) provides for any of the
issuer’s other creditors to rank senior to
the payment of such indebtedness in the
event the issuer becomes the subject of
a bankruptcy or other insolvency
proceeding, with the scope of applicable
bankruptcy or other insolvency
proceedings being defined in the
applicable documentation. The scope of
the definition of a subordinated debt
instrument is meant to capture the types
of entities that issue subordinated debt
instruments and for which the level of
subordination is a meaningful
determinant of the credit risk of the
instrument.

In addition, even though the
provision of collateral typically reduces
the risk of loss on indebtedness, the
proposal includes secured as well as
unsecured subordinated debt securities
in the scope of subordinated debt
instruments, since the effect of
subordination may result in the
collateral providing little or no real
value to the subordinated debt holder in
the event the issuer becomes to subject
of a bankruptcy or other insolvency
proceeding. A subordinated debt
instrument would not include any loan,
including a syndicated loan, a debt
security issued by a sovereign, public
sector entity, multilateral development
bank, or supranational entity, or a
security that would be captured under
the securitization framework. Due to the
contractual obligations and structures
associated with subordinated debt
instruments, such exposures generally
pose increased risk relative to a senior
loan, including a syndicated loan, or a
senior debt security to the same entity
because investments in subordinated
debt instruments are usually considered
junior creditors and subordinate to
obligations specified in the definition of
senior debt in the document governing
the junior creditors’ obligations.
The proposal generally would apply a
150 percent risk weight for exposures
that meet the definition of a
subordinated debt instrument, including
any preferred stock that is not an equity
exposure, and any tier 2 instrument or
covered debt instrument that is not
deducted from regulatory capital,
including TLAC debt instruments, and
any debt instrument that would
otherwise be treated as regulatory
capital by the primary Federal
supervisor of the issuer and that is not
deducted from regulatory capital.71
The instruments included in the
scope of subordinated debt instruments
present a greater risk of loss to an
investing banking organization relative
to more senior debt exposures to the
same issuer because subordinated debt
instruments have a lower priority of
repayment in the event of default. As a
result, the proposal would apply an
increased risk weight to recognize this
71Covered debt instruments are subject to
deduction by banking organizations subject to
Category I or II capital standards similar to the
deduction framework for exposures to capital
instruments. See 12 CFR 3.22(c) (OCC); 12 CFR
217.22(c) (Board); 12 CFR 324.22(c) (FDIC). As
noted in section III.B.3. of this SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION, under the proposal, this deduction
framework will be expanded to banking
organizations subject to Category III or IV capital
standards. As discussed in section III.C.2.b. above,
exposures to subordinated debt instruments issued
by an FHLB or by Farmer Mac would be assigned
a 20 percent risk weight..
increase in loss given default. Since a
covered debt instrument that qualifies
as a TLAC debt instrument shares
similar risk characteristics with a
subordinated debt instrument, the
proposal would require banking
organizations to apply the same 150
percent risk weight to any such
exposures that are not otherwise
deducted from regulatory capital.
Question 20: The agencies seek
comment on the scope of the proposed
definition of a subordinated debt
instrument. What, if any, operational
challenges might the proposed
definition pose for banking
organizations, such as identifying the
level of subordination in debt securities
or similar instruments, and how should
the agencies consider addressing such
challenges?
Question 21: Would expanding the
definition of a subordinated debt
instrument to include loans that are not
securities more appropriately capture
the types of exposures that pose
elevated risk and, if so, why?
Question 22: The agencies seek
comment on applying a heightened 150
percent risk weight to exposures to
subordinated debt instruments issued by
GSEs. What would be the advantages
and disadvantages of this proposed
regulatory capital requirement? Would
there be any challenges for banking
organizations to be able to identify
which GSE exposures would be subject
to the 150 percent risk weight? Please
provide specific examples of any
challenges and supporting data.
e. Real Estate Exposures
The proposal would define a real
estate exposure as an exposure that is
neither a sovereign exposure nor an
exposure to a PSE and that is (1) a
residential mortgage exposure, (2)
secured by collateral in the form of real
estate,72 (3) a pre-sold construction
loan,73 (4) a statutory multifamily
mortgage,74 (5) a high volatility
72For purposes of the proposal, ‘‘secured by
collateral in the form of real estate’’ should be
interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the
current definition for ‘‘a loan secured by real estate’’
in the Call Report and Consolidated Financial
Statements for Holding Companies (FR Y–9C)
instructions.
73The Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing,
Restructuring, and Improvement Act of 1991
(RTCRRI Act) mandates that each agency provide in
its capital regulations (i) a 50 percent risk weight
for certain one-to-four-family residential pre-sold
construction loans that meet specific statutory
criteria in the RTCRRI Act and any other
underwriting criteria imposed by the agencies, and
(ii) a 100 percent risk weight for one-to-four-family
residential pre-sold construction loans for
residences for which the purchase contract is
cancelled. See 12 U.S.C. 1831n, note.
74The RTCRRI Act mandates that each agency
provide in its capital regulations a 50 percent risk
64043
commercial real estate (HVCRE)
exposure,75 or (6) an acquisition,
development, or construction (ADC)
exposure. A pre-sold construction loan,
a statutory multifamily mortgage, and an
HVCRE exposure are collectively
referred to as statutory real estate
exposures for purposes of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. Under the
proposal, the risk weight treatment for
statutory real estate exposures that are
not defaulted real estate exposures
would be consistent with the current
standardized approach.
The proposal would differentiate the
credit risk of real estate exposures that
are not statutory real estate exposures by
introducing the following categories:
regulatory residential real estate
exposures, regulatory commercial real
estate exposures, ADC exposures, and
other real estate exposures. The
applicable risk weight for these non-
statutory real estate exposures would
depend on (1) whether the real estate
exposure meets the definitions of
regulatory residential real estate
exposure, regulatory commercial real
estate exposure, ADC exposure, or other
real estate exposure, described below;
(2) whether the repayment of such
exposures is dependent on the cash
flows generated by the underlying real
estate (such as rental properties, leased
properties, hotels); and (3) in the case of
regulatory residential or regulatory
commercial real estate exposures, the
loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the
exposure.
These proposed criteria for
differentiating the credit risk of real
estate exposures would be based on
information already collected and
maintained by a banking organization as
part
of its mortgage lending activities
and underwriting practices. Under the
proposal, regulatory residential and
regulatory commercial real estate
exposures would be required to meet
prudential criteria that are intended to
reduce the likelihood of default relative
to other real estate exposures. The
criteria in these definitions generally
align with existing Interagency
Guidelines for Real Estate Lending
Policies (real estate lending
weight for certain multifamily residential loans that
meet specific statutory criteria in the RTCRRI Act
and any other underwriting criteria imposed by the
agencies. See 12 U.S.C. 1831n, note.

commitments when cash flows from the
property decrease, such as when tenants
default or properties are unexpectedly
vacant.78 In addition, LTV ratios can be
a useful risk indicator because the
amount of a borrower’s equity in a real
estate property correlates inversely with
default risk and provides banking
organizations with a degree of
protection against losses.79 Therefore,,

the proposal.80 The following chart

borrower’s use of debt (leverage) to finance a real
estate purchase, with higher LTV reflecting greater
leverage and thus higher credit risk..

underwriting process, the banking
organization would be required to apply
underwriting policies that account for
the ability of the borrower to repay
based on clear and measurable
underwriting standards that enable the
banking organization to evaluate these
credit factors. The agencies would
expect these underwriting standards to
be consistent with the agencies’ safety
and soundness and real estate lending
guidelines.83 Fourth, the property must

proposed requirements included in the

ii. Regulatory Commercial Real Estate
Exposures
The proposal would define a
regulatory commercial real estate
exposure as a real estate exposure that
is not a regulatory residential real estate
exposure, a defaulted real estate
exposure, an ADC exposure, a pre-sold
construction loan, a statutory
multifamily mortgage, or an HVCRE
exposure, provided the exposure meets
several prudential criteria. First, the
exposure must be primarily secured by
fully completed real estate. Second, the
banking organization must hold a first
priority security interest in the property
that is legally enforceable in all relevant
jurisdictions.84 Third, the exposure
must be made in accordance with
prudent underwriting standards,
including standards relating to the loan
amount as a percent of the value of the
property. Fourth, during the
underwriting process, the banking
organization must apply underwriting
policies that account for the ability of
the borrower to repay in a timely
manner based on clear and measurable
underwriting standards that enable the
banking organization to evaluate these
credit factors. The agencies would
expect that these underwriting
standards would be consistent with the
agencies’ safety and soundness and real
estate lending guidelines. Finally, the
property must be valued in accordance
with the proposed requirements

.
included in the proposed LTV ratio
calculation, as discussed below.
Question 23: The agencies seek
comment on the application of prudent
underwriting standards in the proposed
definitions of regulatory residential and
regulatory commercial real estate
exposures, including standards relating
to the loan amount as a percent of the
value of the property. What, if any,
further clarity is needed and why?
iii. Exposures That Are Dependent on
the Cash Flows Generated by the Real
Estate
As noted above, the proposal would
differentiate the risk weight of
regulatory residential, regulatory
commercial, and other real estate
exposures based on whether the
borrower’s ability to service the loan is
dependent on cash flows generated by
the real estate. Exposures that are
dependent on the cash flows generated
by real estate to repay the loan can be
affected by local market conditions and
present elevated credit risk relative to
exposures that are serviceable by the
income, cash, or other assets of the
borrower. For example, an increase in
the supply of competitive rental
property can lower demand and
suppress cash flows needed to support
repayment of the loan.
If the underwriting process at
origination of the real estate exposure
considers any cash flows generated by
the real estate securing the loan, such as
from lease or rental payments or from
the sale of the real estate as a source of
repayment, then the exposure would
meet the proposal’s definition of
dependent on the cash flows generated
by the real estate. Evaluating whether
repayment of the exposure is dependent
on cash flows generated from the real
estate is a conservative and
straightforward approach for
differentiating the credit risk of real
estate exposures. Given their increased
credit risk, the proposal would assign
relatively higher risk weights to
exposures that are dependent on any
proceeds or income generated from the
real estate itself to service the debt.
Under the proposal, additional loan
characteristics can affect whether an
exposure would be considered
dependent on cash flows from the real
estate. The proposal’s definition of
dependence on the cash flows generated
by the real estate would exclude any
residential mortgage exposure that is
secured by the borrower’s principal
residence as such mortgage exposures
present reduced credit risk relative to
real estate exposures that are secured by
the borrower’s non-principal
residence.85 For residential properties
that are not the borrower’s principal
residence, including vacation homes
and other second homes, such
properties would be considered
dependent on the cash flows generated
by the real estate unless the banking
organization has relied solely on the
borrower’s personal income and
resources, rather than rental income (or
resale or refinance of the property), to
repay the loan.
For regulatory commercial real estate
exposures, the applicable risk weights
similarly would be determined based on
whether repayment is dependent on the
cash flows generated by the real estate.
For example, the agencies would expect
that rental office buildings, hotels, and
shopping centers leased to tenants are
dependent on the cash flows generated
by the real estate for repayment of the
loan. In the case of a loan to a borrower
to purchase or refinance real estate
where the borrower will operate a
business such as a retail store or factory
and rely solely on the revenues from the
business or resources of the borrower
other than rental, resale, or other
income from the real estate for
repayment, the exposure would not be
considered dependent on the cash flows
generated by the real estate under the
proposal. Similarly, a loan to the owner-
operator of a farm would not be
considered dependent on the cash flows
generated by the real estate under the
proposal if the borrower will rely solely
on the sale of products from the farm or
other resources of the borrower other
than rental, resale, or other income from
the real estate for repayment.
Question 24: What, if any, alternative
quantitative threshold should the
agencies consider in determining
whether a real estate exposure is
dependent on cash flows from the real
estate (for example, a threshold between
5 and 50 percent of the income)?
Further, if the agencies decide to adopt
an alternative quantitative threshold,
either for regulatory residential or
regulatory commercial real estate
exposures, how should it be calibrated
for regulatory residential and separately
for regulatory commercial real estate
exposures and what would be the
appropriate calibration levels for each?
Please provide specific examples of any
85For example, if (1) a borrower purchases a two-
unit property with the intention of making one unit
their principal residence, (2) the borrower intends
to rent out the second unit to a third party, and (3)
the banking organization considered the cash flows
from the rental unit as a source of repayment, the
exposure would not meet the proposal’s definition
of dependent on the cash flows generated by the
real estate because the property securing the
exposure is the borrower’s principal residence.

alternatives, including calculations and
supporting data.
Question 25: The agencies seek
feedback on the proposed treatment of
exposures secured by second homes,
including vacation homes where
repayment of the loan is not dependent
on cash flows. What are the advantages
and disadvantages of treating such
exposures as regulatory residential real
estate exposures? Would a different
category be more appropriate for these
exposures given their risk profile, and if
so, describe which other category(s) of
real estate exposures would be most
similar and why. Please provide
supporting data in your responses.86
Question 26: The agencies seek
comment on the treatment of residential
mortgage exposures where repayment is
dependent on cash flows from overnight
or short-term rentals, as such cash flows
may not be as reliable as a source of
repayment as cash flows from long-term
rental contracts or the borrower’s other
income sources. What would be the
advantages or disadvantages of treating
residential real estate exposures
dependent on cash flows from short-
term rentals similar to commercial real
estate exposures dependent on cash
flows?
iv. Calculating the Loan-To-Value Ratio
The proposal would require a banking
organization also to use LTV ratios to
assign a risk weight to a regulatory
residential or regulatory commercial
real estate exposure. Under the
proposal, LTV ratio would be calculated
as the extension of credit divided by the
value of the property. The proposed
calculation of LTV ratio would be
generally consistent with the real estate
lending guidelines except with respect
to the recognition of private mortgage
insurance, as described below.
The extension of credit would mean
the total outstanding amount of the loan
including any undrawn committed
amount of the loan. The total
outstanding amount of the loan would
reflect the current amortized balance as
the loan pays down, which may allow
a banking organization to assign a lower
risk weight during the life of the loan.
Similarly, if a loan balance increases, a
banking organization would need to
increase the risk weight if the increased
LTV would result in a higher risk
weight. For purposes of the LTV ratio
calculation, a banking organization
would calculate the loan amount
86See Garcia, Daniel (2019). ‘‘Second Home
Buyers and the Housing Boom and Bust,’’ Finance
and Economics Discussion Series 2019–029.
Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, https://www.federalreserve.gov/
econres/feds/files/2019029pap.pdf.
without making any adjustments for
credit loss provisions or private
mortgage insurance. Not recognizing
private mortgage insurance would be
consistent with the current capital rule’s
definition of eligible guarantor, which
does not recognize an insurance
company engaged predominately in the
business of providing credit protection
(such as a monoline bond insurer or re-
insurer) and also reflects the
performance of private mortgage
insurance during times of stress in the
housing market. The agencies do not
intend the proposed risk weights to be
applied to LTVs that include private
mortgage insurance.
The value of the property would mean
the value at the time of origination of all
real estate properties securing or being
improved by the extension of credit,
plus the fair value of any readily
marketable collateral and other
acceptable collateral, as defined in the
real estate lending guidelines, that
secures the extension of credit.
For
exposures subject to the Real
Estate Lending, Appraisal Standards,
and Minimum Requirements for
Appraisal Management Companies or
Appraisal Standards for Federally
Related Transactions (combined, the
appraisal rule),87 the market value of
real estate would be a valuation that
meets all requirements of that rule. For
exposures not subject to the appraisal
rule, the proposal would require that (1)
the market value of real estate be
obtained from an independent valuation
of the property using prudently
conservative valuation criteria and (2)
the valuation be done independently
from the banking organization’s
origination and underwriting process.
Most real estate exposures held by
insured depository institutions are
subject to the agencies’ appraisal rule,
which also provides for evaluations in
some cases, and provides for certain
exceptions, such as where a lien on real
estate is taken as an abundance of
caution. To help ensure that the value
of the real estate is determined in a
prudently conservative manner, the
proposal would also provide that, for
exposures not subject to the appraisal
rule, the valuations of the real estate
properties would need to exclude
expectations of price increases and be
adjusted downward to take into account
the potential for the current market
prices to be significantly above the
values that would be sustainable over
the life of the loan.
87See 12 CFR part 34, subpart C or subpart G
(OCC); 12 CFR part 208, subpart E or 12 CFR part
225, subpart G (Board); 12 CFR part 323 (FDIC).
64047
In addition, when the real estate
exposure finances the purchase of the
property, the value would be the lower
of (1) the actual acquisition cost of the
property and (2) the market value
obtained from either (i) the valuation
requirements under the appraisal rule (if
applicable) or (ii) as described above, an
independent valuation using prudently
conservative valuation criteria that is
separate from the banking organization’s
origination and underwriting process.
Supervisory experience has shown that
market values of real estate properties
can be temporarily impacted by local
market forces and using a value figure
including such volatility would not
reflect the long-term value of the real
estate. Therefore, the proposal would
require that the value used for the LTV
calculation be an amount that is more
conservative than the market value of
the property.
Using the value of the property at
origination when calculating the LTV
ratio protects against volatility risk or
short-term market price inflation. For
purposes of the LTV ratio calculation,
the proposal would require banking
organizations to use the value of the
property at the time of origination,
except under the following
circumstances: (1) the banking
organization’s primary Federal
supervisor requires the banking
organization to revise the property value
downward; (2) an extraordinary event
occurs resulting in a permanent
reduction of the property value (for
example, a natural disaster); or (3)
modifications are made to the property
that increase its market value and are
supported by an appraisal or
independent evaluation using prudently
conservative criteria. These proposed
exceptions are intended to constrain the
use of values other than the value of the
property at loan origination only to
exceptional circumstances that are
sufficiently material to warrant use of a
revised valuation.
For purposes of determining the value
of the property, the proposal would use
the definition of readily marketable
collateral and other acceptable collateral
consistent with the real estate lending
guidelines. Therefore, readily
marketable collateral would mean
insured deposits, financial instruments,
and bullion in which the banking
organization has a perfected security
interest. Financial instruments and
bullion would need to be salable under
ordinary circumstances with reasonable
promptness at a fair market value
determined by quotations based on
actual transactions, on an auction or
similarly available daily bid and ask
price market. Readily marketable

organization’s usual practices for

Other acceptable collateral would mean
any collateral in which the banking
organization has a perfected security

is accepted by the banking organization
in accordance with safe and sound
lending practices. Other acceptable
collateral should be appropriately
discounted by the banking organization
consistent with the banking
organization’s usual practices for
making loans secured by such collateral.
Under the proposal, other acceptable
collateral would include, among other
items, unconditional irrevocable
standby letters of credit for the benefit
of the banking organization. The
reasonableness of a banking
organization’s underwriting criteria
would be reviewed through the
examination and supervisory process to
help ensure its real estate lending
policies are consistent with safe and
sound banking practices.
Question 27: What are the benefits
and drawbacks of allowing readily
marketable collateral and other
acceptable collateral to be included in
the value for purposes of calculating the
LTV ratio? What are the advantages and
disadvantages of providing specific
discount factors to the value of
acceptable collateral for purposes of
calculating the LTV ratio such as the
standard supervisory market price
volatility haircuts contained in
§ .121 of the proposed rule? What
alternatives should the agencies
consider? Please provide specific
examples and supporting data.
v. Risk Weights for Regulatory
Residential Real Estate Exposures
Under the proposal, a banking
organization would assign a risk weight
to a regulatory residential real estate
exposure based on the exposure’s LTV
ratio and whether the exposure is
dependent on the cash flows generated
by the real estate, as reflected in Tables
2 and 3 below. LTV ratios and
dependence on cash flows generated by
the real estate would factor into the risk-
weight treatment for real estate
exposures under the proposal because
these risk factors can be determinants of
credit risk for real estate exposures. The
proposed corresponding risk weights in
each LTV ratio category are intended to
appropriately reflect differences in the
credit risk of these exposures. The risk
weights that would apply under the
proposal are provided below.88
While LTV ratios and dependency
upon cash flows of the real estate are
useful risk indicators, the agencies
recognize that banking organizations
consider a variety of factors when
underwriting a residential real estate
exposure and assessing a borrower’s
ability to repay. For example, a banking
organization may consider a borrower’s
current and expected income, current
and expected cash flows, net worth,
other relevant financial resources,
current financial obligations,
employment status, credit history, or
other relevant factors during the
underwriting process. The agencies are
supportive of home ownership and do
not intend the proposal to diminish

impact the appropriate treatment of loans under the
agencies’ other regulations and guidance, such as
the supervisory LTV limits under the real estate
lending guidelines.
home affordability or homeownership
opportunities, including for low- and
moderate-income (LMI) home buyers or
other historically underserved markets.
The agencies are particularly interested
in whether the proposed framework for
regulatory residential real estate
exposures should be modified in any
way to avoid unintended impacts on the
ability of otherwise credit-worthy
borrowers who make a smaller down
payment to purchase a home. For
example, the agencies are considering
whether a 50 percent risk weight would
be appropriate for these loans, to the
extent they are originated in accordance
with prudent underwriting standards
and originated through a home
ownership program that the primary
Federal regulatory agency determines
provides a public benefit and includes
risk mitigation features such as credit
counseling and consideration of
repayment ability.
Question 28: The agencies seek
comment on how the proposed
treatment of regulatory residential real
estate exposures will impact home
affordability and home ownership
opportunities, particularly for LMI
borrowers or other historically
underserved markets. What are the
advantages and disadvantages of an
alternative treatment that would assign
a 50 percent risk weight to mortgage
loans originated in accordance with

prudent underwriting standards and
originated through a home ownership
program that the primary Federal
regulatory agency determines provides a
public benefit and includes risk
mitigation features such as credit
counseling and consideration of
repayment ability? What, if any,
additional or alternative risk indicators
should the agencies consider, besides
loan-to-value or dependency upon cash
flow for risk-weighting regulatory
residential real estate exposures? Please
provide specific examples of mortgage
lending programs where such factors
were the basis for underwriting the
loans and the historical repayment
performance of the loans in such
programs. Please comment on whether
these risk indicators are already
collected and maintained by banking
organizations as part of their mortgage
lending activities and underwriting
practices.
In addition, the agencies considered
adopting an alternative risk-based
capital treatment in subpart E that does
not rely on loan-to-value ratios or
dependency upon cash flow generated
by the real estate. One such alternative
would be to incorporate the same
treatment for residential mortgage
exposures as found in the current U.S.
standardized risk-based capital
framework. Under this alternative, the
risk-based capital treatment for
residential mortgage exposures in
subpart D of the capital rule would be
incorporated into the proposed subpart
E. First-lien residential mortgage
exposures that are prudently
underwritten would receive a 50
percent risk weight consistent with the
treatment contained in the U.S.
standardized risk-based capital
framework. Such an approach would
allow banking organizations to continue
to offer prudently underwritten
products through lending programs with
the flexibility to meet the needs of their
communities without additional
regulatory capital implications. The
agencies note that current mortgage
rules promulgated since the global
financial crisis require lenders to
consider each borrower’s ability to
repay.89
As in subpart D, residential mortgage
exposures that do not meet the
requirements necessary to receive a 50
percent risk weight would receive a 100
percent risk weight. While such an
approach would not use loan-to-value or
dependency upon cash flow generated
by the real estate to assign a risk-weight,
it would provide for a simpler
framework where all prudently
underwritten first-lien residential
mortgage exposures would receive the
same risk-based capital treatment. Lastly
and consistent with the treatment in
subpart D, if a banking organization
holds the first and junior lien(s) on a
regulatory residential real estate
exposure and no other party holds an
intervening lien, the banking
organization would be required to treat
the combined exposure as a single loan
secured by a first lien for purposes of
assigning a risk weight.
Question 29: The agencies seek
comment on assigning risk weights to
64049
residential mortgage exposures,
consistent with the current U.S.
standardized risk-based capital
framework. What are the pros and cons
of this alternative treatment?
vi. Risk Weights for Regulatory
Commercial Real Estate Exposures
In a manner similar to regulatory
residential real estate exposure, the
proposal would require a banking
organization to assign a risk weight to a
regulatory commercial real estate
exposure based on the exposure’s LTV
ratio and whether the exposure is
dependent on the cash flows generated
by the real estate, as reflected in Tables
4 and 5 below. For regulatory
commercial real estate exposures that
are not dependent on cash flows for
repayment, the main driver of risk to the
banking organization is whether the
commercial borrower would generate
sufficient revenue through its non-real
estate business activities to repay the
loan to the banking organization. For
this reason, under Table 4 the proposed
risk weight for the exposure would be
dependent on the risk weight assigned
to the borrower. For the purposes of
Table 4, if the LTV ratio of the
exposures is greater than 60 percent,
and the banking organization does not
have sufficient information about the
exposure to determine what the risk
weight applicable to the borrower
would be, the banking organization
would be required to assign a 100
percent risk weight to the exposure.

exposures, consistent with the approach
to defaulted exposures described in
section III.C.2.a. of this SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION. The proposal would
introduce a definition of defaulted real
estate exposure that would provide new
criteria for determining whether a
residential mortgage exposure or a non-
residential mortgage exposure is in
default. These new criteria are
indicative of a credit-related default for
such exposures. For residential
mortgage exposures, the definition of
defaulted real estate exposure would
require the banking organization to
evaluate default at the exposure level.
For other real estate exposures that are
not residential mortgage exposures, the
definition of defaulted real estate
exposure would require the banking
organization to evaluate default at the
obligor level, consistent with the
approach describe above for non-retail
defaulted exposures.
Since residential mortgage exposures
are primarily originated to individuals
for the purchase or refinancing of their
primary residence, most obligors of
residential real estate exposures do not
have additional real estate exposures.
Therefore, determining default at the
exposure level would account for the
material default risk of most residential
mortgage exposures. Additionally,
evaluating defaulted residential
mortgage exposures at the obligor level
may be difficult for banking
organizations to operationalize, for
example, if there are challenges
collecting information on the payment
status of other obligations of individual
borrowers.
In contrast, for other types of real
estate exposures, such as regulatory
commercial real estate and ADC
exposures, evaluating default at the
obligor level would be more appropriate
and less challenging as those obligors
frequently have other credit obligations
that are large in value and potentially
held by multiple banking organizations.
Default by an obligor on other credit
obligations, which a banking
organization should account for when
evaluating the risk profile of the
borrower, would indicate increased
credit risk of the exposure held by a
banking organization.
A defaulted real estate exposure that
is a residential mortgage exposure
would include an exposure (1) that is 90
days or more past due or in nonaccrual
status; (2) where the banking
organization has taken a partial charge-
off, write-down of principal, or negative
fair value adjustment on the exposure
for credit-related reasons, until the
banking organization has reasonable
assurance of repayment and
performance for all contractual
principal and interest payments on the
exposure; or (3) where the banking
organization agreed to a distressed
restructuring that includes the following
credit-related reasons: forgiveness or
postponement of principal, interest, or
fees; term extension; or an interest rate
reduction. Distressed restructuring
would not include a loan modified or
restructured solely pursuant to the U.S.
Treasury’s Home Affordable Mortgage
Program.90
To determine if a non-residential
mortgage exposure would be a defaulted
real estate exposure, banking
organizations would apply the same
criteria as described above in section
III.C.2.a. of this SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION that are used to determine
if a non-retail exposure is a defaulted
exposure. Banking organizations are
expected to conduct ongoing credit
reviews of relevant obligors. The
proposal would require banking
organizations to continue to treat non-
residential real estate exposures that
meet this definition as defaulted real
estate exposures until the non-
residential real estate exposure no
longer meets the definition or until the
banking organization determines that
the obligor meets the definition of
investment grade or speculative grade.
Under the proposal, a defaulted real
estate exposure that is a residential
mortgage exposure not dependent on
the cash flows generated by the real
estate would receive a risk weight of 100
percent, regardless of whether the
exposure qualifies as a regulatory real
estate exposure, unless a portion of the
real estate exposure is guaranteed under
§ ll.120 of the proposal. This
treatment is consistent with the risk
weight for past due residential mortgage
exposures under the current
standardized approach. Additionally, a
residential mortgage guaranteed by the
Federal Government through the
Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
or the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) generally will be risk-weighted at
20 percent under the proposal,
including a residential mortgage
guaranteed by FHA or VA that meets the
defaulted real estate exposure
definition.
Any other defaulted real estate
exposure would receive a risk weight of
150 percent, including any other non-
residential real estate exposure to the
same obligor, consistent with the
90The U.S. Treasury’s Home Affordable Mortgage
Program was created under the Troubled Asset
Relief Program in response to the subprime
mortgage crisis of 2008. See Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act, Public Law 110–343, 122 Stat.
3765 (2008).
proposed risk weight of other defaulted
exposures described in section II.C.2.a.
of this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. A
banking organization may apply a risk
weight to the guaranteed portion of
defaulted real estate exposures based on
the risk weight that applies under
§ .120 of the proposal if the
guarantee or credit derivative meets the
applicable requirements.
Question 31: How does the defaulted
real estate exposure definition compare
with banking organizations’ existing
policies relating to the determination of
the credit risk of defaulted real estate
exposures and the creditworthiness of
defaulted real estate obligors? What, if
any, additional clarifications are
necessary to determine the point at
which residential and non-residential
mortgages should no longer be treated
as defaulted exposures? Please provide
specific examples and supporting data.
Question 32: For purposes of
commercial real estate exposures, the
agencies invite comment on the extent
to which obligors have outstanding
other exposures with multiple banking
organizations and other creditors. What
would be the advantages and
disadvantages of considering both the
obligor and the parent company or other
entity or individual that owns or
controls the obligor when determining if
the exposure meets the criteria for
‘‘defaulted real estate exposure’’?
Question 33: For purposes of
residential mortgage exposures, the
agencies invite comment on the
appropriateness of including a
borrower’s bankruptcy as a criterion for
defaulted real estate exposure. Would
criteria (1)(i) through (1)(iii) in the
proposed defaulted real estate definition
for residential mortgages sufficiently
capture the risk of a borrower involved
in a bankruptcy proceeding?
viii. ADC Exposures That Are Not
HVCRE Exposures
Under the proposal, the agencies
would define an ADC exposure as an
exposure secured by real estate for the
purpose of acquiring, developing, or
constructing residential or commercial
real estate properties, as well as all land
development loans, and all other land
loans. Some ADC exposures meet the
definition of HVCRE exposure in
§ .2 of the capital rule and would be
assigned a 150 percent risk weight.91
Real estate exposures that meet the

(EGRRCPA) imposes certain requirements on high

definition of ADC exposure but do not
meet the criteria of an HVCRE exposure
or a defaulted real estate exposure
would be assigned a 100 percent risk
weight under the proposal. The
proposed regulatory treatment for ADC
exposures would not take into
consideration cash flow dependency or
LTV ratio criteria. ADC exposures are
mostly short-term or bridge loans to
cover construction or development, or
lease up or sales phases of a real estate
project, rather than an amortizing
permanent loan for completed
residential or commercial real estate.
Supervisory experience has shown that
ADC exposures have heightened risk
compared to permanent commercial real
estate exposures, and these exposures
generally have been subject to a risk
weight of 100 percent or more under the
current standardized approach.
Repayment of ADC loans is often based
on the expected completion of the
construction or development of the
property, which can be delayed or
interrupted by many factors such as
changes in market condition or financial
difficulty of the obligor.
ix. Other Real Estate Exposures
The proposal would define other real
estate exposures as real estate exposures
that are not defaulted real estate
exposures, regulatory commercial real
estate exposures, regulatory residential
real estate exposures, ADC exposures, or
any
of the statutory real estate
exposures.
An exposure meeting the proposed
definition of other real estate exposure
poses heightened credit risk as a result
of not meeting the proposed prudential
underwriting criteria included in the
definitions of regulatory residential and
regulatory commercial real estate,
respectively, and accordingly would be
assigned a higher risk weight.
Specifically, the proposal would require
a banking organization to assign a 150
percent risk weight to an other real
estate exposure, unless the exposure
a residential mortgage exposure that is
not dependent on the cash flows
generated by the real estate, which must
be assigned a 100 percent risk weight.
is
For example, a banking organization
would assign a 150 percent risk weight
to real estate exposures that are
dependent on the cash flows generated
by the underlying real estate, such as a
rental property, and that do not meet the
regulatory residential or regulatory
commercial real estate exposure
definitions. Loans for the purpose of
acquiring real estate and reselling it at
higher value that do not qualify as ADC
loans and do not meet the definition of
regulatory residential real estate
exposures would be assigned a 150
percent risk weight as other real estate
exposures. The proposed 150 percent
risk weight also would provide a
regulatory capital incentive for banking
organizations to originate real estate
exposures in accordance with the
prudential qualification requirements
for regulatory residential and
commercial real estate exposures,
respectively.
In other cases, if a banking
organization does not adequately
evaluate the creditworthiness of a
borrower for an owner-occupied
residential mortgage exposure, or if the
borrower has inadequate
creditworthiness or capacity to repay
the loan, the exposure would not be
considered prudently underwritten and
would be assigned a 100 percent risk
weight instead of the lower risk weights
included in Table 2 for regulatory
residential mortgage exposures not
dependent on the cash flows generated
by the real estate. The 100 percent risk
weight would also apply to junior lien
home equity lines of credit and other
second mortgages given the elevated
risk of these loans when compared to
similar senior lien loans.
f. Retail Exposures
Relative to the current standardized
approach, and as described in more
detail below, the proposal would
increase the credit risk-sensitivity of the
capital requirements applicable to retail
exposures by assigning risk weights that
would vary depending on product type
and the degree of portfolio
diversification. The proposal would
introduce a new definition of retail
exposure, which would include an
exposure to a natural person or persons,
or an exposure to a small or medium-
sized entity (SME) 92 that meets the
proposed definition of a regulatory retail
exposure described below. Including an
exposure to an SME in the definition of
a retail exposure provides a benefit for
small companies, such as smaller
limited liability companies, which may
have characteristics more similar to
those of a natural person than of a larger
corporation. The proposed definition of
a retail exposure would be narrower in
scope than the current capital rule’s
existing definition of a retail exposure
92An SME would mean an entity in which the
reported annual revenues or sales for the
consolidated group of which the entity is a part are
less than or equal to $50 million for the most recent
fiscal year. This scope is generally consistent with
the definition of an SME under the Basel III reforms
and also corresponds with the maximum receipts-
based size standard for small businesses set by the
Small Business Administration, which varies by
industry and does not exceed $47 million per year.
See 13 CFR part 121.
64051
under subpart E, which includes a
broader range of exposures, including
real estate-related exposures. Because
the proposal would include separate
risk-weight treatments for real estate
exposures that account for the
underlying collateral, the proposed
definition of a retail exposure would
only apply to a retail exposure that
would not otherwise be a real estate
exposure.93
The proposal would differentiate the
risk-weight treatment for retail
exposures based on whether (1) the
exposure qualifies as a regulatory retail
exposure, (2) further qualifies as a
transactor exposure; or (3) does not
qualify for either of the previous
categories and is treated as an other
retail exposure. The proposed
definitions of a regulatory retail
exposure and a transactor exposure
outlined below include key criteria for
broadly categorizing the relative credit
risk of retail exposures.
To qualify as a regulatory retail
exposure, the proposal would require
the exposure to be in the form of any of
the following credit products: a
revolving credit or line of credit (such
as a credit card, charge card, or
overdraft) or a term loan or lease (such
as an installment loan, auto loan or
lease, or student or educational loan)
(collectively, eligible products). In
addition, under the proposal, the
amount of retail exposures that a
banking organization could treat as
regulatory retail exposures would be
limited on an aggregate and granular
basis. A banking organization would
include all outstanding and committed
but unfunded regulatory retail
exposures accounting for any applicable
credit conversion factor when
aggregating the retail exposures.
Specifically, the regulatory retail
exposure category would exclude any
retail exposure to a single obligor and its
affiliates that, in the aggregate with any
other retail exposures to that obligor or
its affiliates, including both on- and off-
balance sheet exposures, exceeds a
combined total of $1 million (aggregate
limit).
In addition, for any single retail
exposure, only the portion up to 0.2
percent of the banking organization’s
total retail exposures that are eligible
products (granularity limit) would be
considered a regulatory retail exposure.
93For an exposure that qualifies as a real estate
exposure and also meets conditions (1) and (2) of
the definition of a retail exposure, the proposal
would require a banking organization to treat the
exposure as a real estate exposure and calculate
risk-based requirements for the exposure as
described in section III.C.2.e of this SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION.

Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 179 / Monday, September 18, 2023 / Proposed Rules
The portion of any single retail exposure
that exceeds the granularity limit would
not qualify as a regulatory retail
exposure. For purposes of calculating
the 0.2 percent granularity limit for a
regulatory retail exposure, off-balance
sheet exposures would be subject to the
applicable credit conversion factors, as
discussed in § ll.112(b), and
defaulted exposures, as discussed in
§ ll.101(b) of the proposal, would be
excluded. Under the proposal, if an
exposure to an SME does not meet
criteria (1) through (3) of the definition
of a regulatory retail exposure, then
none of the exposures to that SME
would qualify as retail exposures and all
of the exposures to that SME would be
treated as corporate exposures.
The proposal would define a
transactor exposure as a regulatory retail
exposure that is a credit facility where
the balance has been repaid in full at
each scheduled repayment date for the
previous twelve months or an overdraft
facility where there has been no
drawdown over the previous twelve
months. If a single obligor had both a
credit facility and an overdraft facility
from the same banking organization, the
banking organization would separately
evaluate each facility to determine
whether each facility would meet the
definition of a transactor exposure to be
categorized as a transactor exposure.
Under the proposal, a banking
organization would assign a risk weight
of 55 percent to a regulatory retail
exposure that is a transactor exposure
and an 85 percent risk weight to a
regulatory retail exposure that is not a
transactor exposure. All other retail
exposures would be assigned a 110
percent risk weight. The proposed 55
percent risk weight for a transactor
exposure is appropriate because obligors
that demonstrate a historical repayment
capacity generally exhibit less credit
risk relative to other retail obligors. A
regulatory retail exposure that is not a
transactor exposure warrants the
proposed 85 percent risk weight, which
would be lower than the proposed 110
percent risk weight for all other retail
exposures, due to mitigating factors
related to size or concentration risk. The
aggregate limit and granularity limit are
intended to ensure that the regulatory
retail portfolio consists of a set of small
exposures to a diversified group of
obligors, which would reduce credit risk
to the banking organization. Conversely,
banking organizations with a high
aggregate amount of retail exposures to
a single obligor, or exposures exceeding
the granularity limit, have a heightened
concentration of retail exposures. This
concentration of retail exposures
increases the level of credit risk the
banking organization has to a single
obligor, and the likelihood that the
banking organization could face
material losses if the obligor misses a
payment or defaults. Therefore, any
retail exposure that would not qualify as
a regulatory retail or a transactor
exposure warrants a risk weight of 110
percent.
The following example describes how
a banking organization would identify
the amount of retail exposures that
could be treated as regulatory retail
exposures. First, a banking organization
would identify the amount of credit
exposures that meet the eligible
products criterion within the definition
of a regulatory retail exposure. Assume
a banking organization has $100 million
in total retail exposures that meet the
eligible regulatory retail product
criterion described above. Next, for this
set of exposures, the banking
organization would identify any
amounts to a single obligor and its
affiliates that exceed $1 million. The
banking organization in this example
determines that a single obligor and its
affiliates account for an aggregate of $20
million of the banking organization’s
total retail exposures. Because this $20
million exceeds the $1 million
threshold for amounts to a single obligor
and its affiliates, this $20 million would
be retail exposures that are not
regulatory retail exposures and subject
to a 110 percent risk weight, leaving $80
million that could be categorized as
regulatory retail exposures.
Also, assume that of the $80 million,
$1 million of the exposures are
considered defaulted exposures. This $1
million in defaulted exposures would be
subtracted from the $80 million. The
banking organization would multiply
the remaining $79 million by the 0.2
percent granularity limit, with the
resulting $158,000 representing the
dollar amount equivalent of the
granularity limit for this banking
organization’s retail portfolio. Therefore,
of the remaining $79 million, the
portion of those retail exposures to a
single obligor and its affiliates that do
not exceed $158,000 would be
considered regulatory retail exposures.
Of the regulatory retail exposures, the
portion of the exposure that would
qualify as a transactor exposure would
receive a 55 percent risk weight and the
remaining portion would receive an 85
percent risk weight. Under the proposal,
a banking organization would assign a
110 percent risk weight to the portion of
a retail exposure that exceeds the
granularity limit. Thus, the total amount
of retail exposures to a single obligor
exceeding $158,000 in this example
would receive a 110 percent risk weight
as other retail exposures. This example
is also illustrated in the following
decision tree.

Question 34: What, if any, additional
criteria or alternatives should the
agencies consider to help ensure that
the regulatory retail treatment is limited
to a group of diversified retail obligors?
What alternative thresholds or
calibrations should the agencies
consider for purposes of retail
exposures? Please provide supporting
data in your response.
Question 35: What simplifications, if
any, to the calculation described above
for a regulatory retail exposure should
the agencies consider to reduce
operational complexity for banking
organizations? For example, what
operational challenges would arise from
assigning differing risk weights to
portions of retail exposures based on the
regulatory retail eligibility criteria?
Question 36: Is the requirement for
repayment of a credit facility in full at
each scheduled repayment date for the
previous twelve months or lack of
overdraft history an appropriate
criterion to distinguish the credit risk of
a transactor exposure from other retail
exposures, and if not, what would be
more appropriate and why? Is twelve
months of full repayment history a
sufficient amount of time to
demonstrate a consistent repayment
history of the credit or overdraft facility
to meet the definition of a transactor
and if not, what would be an
appropriate amount of time?
g. Risk-Weight Multiplier for Certain
Retail and Residential Mortgage
Exposures With Currency Mismatch
The proposal would introduce a new
requirement for banking organizations
to apply a multiplier to the applicable
risk weight assigned to certain
exposures that contain currency
mismatches between the banking
organization’s lending currency and the
borrower’s source of repayment. The
multiplier would reflect the borrower’s
increased risk of default due to the
borrower’s exposure to foreign exchange
risk. The multiplier would apply to
exposure types where the borrower
generally does not manage or hedge its
foreign exchange risk. Exposures with
such currency mismatches pose
increased credit risk to the banking
organization as the borrower’s
repayment ability could be affected by
exchange rate fluctuations.
To capture this increased risk, the
proposal would require banking
organizations to apply a 1.5 multiplier
to the applicable risk weight, subject to
a maximum risk weight of 150 percent,
for retail and residential mortgage
exposures to a borrower that does not
have a source of repayment in the
currency of the loan equal to at least 90
percent of the annual payment from
either income generated through
ordinary business activities or from a
contract with a financial institution that
provides funds denominated in the
currency of the loan, such as a forward
exchange contract. Other types of
exposures generally account for foreign
exchange risk through hedging or other
risk mitigants and would not be subject
to the proposed multiplier. The
proposed risk weight ceiling of 150
percent aligns with the maximum risk
weight for credit exposures under the
proposal.
Question 37: What, if any, additional
or alternative criteria of the proposed
multiplier should the agencies consider
and why?
h. Corporate Exposures
A corporate exposure under the
proposal would be an exposure to a
company that does not fall under any
other exposure category under the
proposal. This scope would be
consistent with the definition found in
§ .2 of the current capital rule. For
example, an exposure to a corporation
that also meets the proposed definition
of a real estate exposure would be a real
estate exposure rather than a corporate
exposure for purposes of the proposal.
As described in more detail below,
the proposal would differentiate the risk
weights of corporate exposures based on
credit risk by considering such factors
as a corporate exposure’s investment
quality and the general creditworthiness
of the borrower, level of subordination,
as well as the nature and substance of
the lending arrangement, and the degree
of reliance on the borrower’s
independent capacity for repayment of
the obligation, or reliance on the income
that the borrowing entity is expected to
generate from the asset(s) or a project
being financed. First, a banking
organization would assign a 65 percent
risk weight to a corporate exposure that
is an exposure to a company that is
investment grade, and that has a
publicly traded security outstanding or
that is controlled by a company that has

Second, consistent with the current
standardized approach, a banking
organization would assign risk weights
of 2 percent or 4 percent to certain
exposures to a qualifying central
counterparty.95 Third, as discussed
further below, a banking organization
would assign a 130 percent risk weight
to a project finance exposure that is not
a project finance operational phase
exposure. Fourth, a banking
organization would assign a 150 percent

INFORMATION.
engage
Finally, a banking organization would
assign a 100 percent risk weight to all
other corporate exposures. Assigning a
100 percent risk weight to all other
corporate exposures appropriately
reflects the relative risk of such
corporate exposures, as the repayment
methods for these exposures pose
greater risks than those of publicly-
traded corporate exposures that are
deemed investment grade. A banking
organization would also assign a 100
percent risk weight to corporate
exposures that finance income-
producing assets or projects that
in non-real estate activities where the
obligor has no independent capacity to
repay the loan. For example, corporate
exposures subject to the 100 percent risk
weight would include exposures (i) for
the purpose of acquiring or financing
equipment where repayment of the
exposure is dependent on the cash flows
generated by either the equipment being
financed or acquired, (ii) for the purpose
of acquiring or financing physical
commodities where repayment of the
exposure is dependent on the proceeds
from the sale of the physical
commodities, and (iii) project finance
operational phase exposures, as further
discussed below.
i. Investment Grade Companies With
Publicly Traded Securities Outstanding
Under the proposal, a banking
organization would assign a 65 percent
risk weight to a corporate exposure that
is both (1) an exposure to a company
that is investment grade, and (2) where
94Under §ll.2 of the current capital rule, a
person or company controls a company if it: (1)
owns, controls, or holds with power to vote 25
percent or more of a class of voting securities of the
company; or (2) consolidates the company for
financial reporting purposes. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC);
12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
95See 12 CFR 3.32(f)(2) and (3) (OCC); 12 CFR
217.32(f)(2) and (3) (Board); 12 CFR 324.32(f)(2) and
(3) (FDIC).
that
company, or a parent that controls
that company, has publicly traded
securities outstanding.96 This two-
pronged test would serve as a
reasonable basis for banking
organizations to identify exposures to
obligors of sufficient creditworthiness to
be eligible for a reduced risk weight.

directly addresses the credit quality of
the exposure by requiring that the entity
or reference entity have adequate
capacity to meet financial commitments,
which means that the risk of its default
is low and the full and timely
repayment of principal and interest is
expected. A banking organization’s
investment grade analysis is dependent
upon the banking organization’s
underwriting criteria, judgment, and
assumptions.
The proposed requirement that the
company or its parent company have
securities outstanding that are publicly
traded, in contrast, would be a simple,
objective criterion that would provide a
degree of consistency across banking
organizations. Further, publicly-traded
corporate entities are subject to
enhanced transparency and market
discipline as a result of being listed
publicly on an exchange. A banking
organization would use these simple
criteria, which complement a banking
organization’s due diligence and
internal credit analysis, to determine
whether a corporate exposure qualifies
as an investment grade exposure.
Question 38: What, if any, alternative
criteria should the agencies consider to
identify corporate exposures that would
warrant a risk weight of 65 percent or
a risk weight between 65 percent and
100 percent?
Question 39: For what reasons, if any,
should the agencies consider applying a
lower risk weight than 100 percent to
exposures to companies that are not
publicly traded but are companies that
are ‘‘highly regulated?’’ What, if any,
criteria should the agencies consider to
identify companies that are ‘‘highly
regulated?’’ Alternatively, what are the
advantages and disadvantages of
assigning lower risk weights to highly
regulated entities (such as open-ended
mutual funds, mutual insurance
companies, pension funds, or registered
investment companies)?
96Under §ll.2 of the current capital rule,
publicly-traded means traded on: (1) any exchange
registered with the SEC as a national securities
exchange under section 6 of the Securities
Exchange Act; or (2) any non-U.S.-based securities
exchange that: (i) is registered with, or approved by,
a national securities regulatory authority; and (ii)
provides a liquid, two-way market for the
instrument in question. See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12
CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
Question 40: What are the advantages
and disadvantages of applying a lower
risk weight (such as between 85 and 100
percent), to entities based on size, such
as companies with reported annual
sales of less than or equal to $50 million
for the most recent financial year? What
alternative criteria, if any, should the
agencies consider to identify small or
medium-sized entities that present
lower credit risk? For example, should
the agencies consider asset size or
number of employees to identify small
or medium-sized entities? Please
provide supporting data.
Question 41: What criteria, if any,
should the agencies consider to further
differentiate corporate exposures
according to their risk profiles and what
implications would such criteria have
for the risk weighting of these exposures
and why?
ii. Project Finance Exposures
The proposal would define a project
finance exposure as a corporate
exposure for which the banking
organization relies on the revenues
generated by a single project (typically
a large and complex installation, such as
power plants, manufacturing plants,
transportation infrastructure,
telecommunications, or other similar
installations), both as the source of
repayment and as security for the loan.
For example, a project finance exposure
could take the form of financing the
construction of a new installation, or a
refinancing of an existing installation,
with or without improvements. The
primary determinant of credit risk for a
project finance exposure is the
variability of the cash flows expected to
be generated by the project being
financed rather than the general
creditworthiness of the obligor or the
market value or sale of the project or the
real estate on which the project sits.97 A
project finance exposure also would be
required to meet the following criteria:
(1) the exposure would need to be to a
borrowing entity that was created
specifically to finance the project,
operate the physical assets of the
project, or do both, and (2) the
borrowing entity would need to have an
immaterial amount of assets, activities,
or sources of income apart from
revenues from the activities of the
project being financed. Under the
proposal, an exposure that is deemed
secured by real estate,98 would not be
97Exposures that are guaranteed by the
government or considered a general obligation or
revenue obligation exposure to a PSE would not
qualify as a project finance exposure.

Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 179 / Monday, September 18, 2023 / Proposed Rules
considered a project finance exposure
and would be assigned a risk weight as
described in section III.C.2.e. of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.
Under the proposal, a project finance
exposure would receive a 130 percent
risk weight during the pre-operational
phase and a 100 percent risk weight
during the operational phase. The
proposal would define a project finance
operational phase exposure as a project
finance exposure where the project has
a positive net cash flow that is sufficient
to support the debt service and expenses
of the project and any other remaining
contractual obligation, in accordance
with the banking organization’s
applicable loan underwriting criteria for
permanent financings, and where the
outstanding long-term debt of the
project is declining. Prior to the
operational phase classification, a
banking organization would be required
to treat a project finance exposure as
being in the pre-operational phase and
assign a 130 percent risk weight to the
exposure. The pre-operational phase
would be the period between the
origination of the loan and the time at
which the banking organization
determines that the project has entered
the operational phase. Relative to the
operational phase, the pre-operational
phase presents increased uncertainty
that the project will be completed in a
timely and cost-effective manner, which
warrants the application of a higher risk
weight. For example, market conditions
could change significantly between
commencement and completion of the
project. In addition, unanticipated
supply shortages could disrupt timely
completion of the project and the
expected timing of the transition to the
operational phase. These unanticipated
changes could disrupt the completion of
the project and delay it becoming
operational, and thus impact the ability
of the project to generate cash flows as
projected and to repay creditors.
Question 42: What additional
exposures, if any, should be captured by
the proposed definition of a project
finance exposure? What exposures, if
any, captured by the proposed
definition of a project finance exposure
should be excluded from the definition?
. 
project for security and lender control purposes, a
project finance exposure would not be considered
a real estate exposure because the banking
organization does not rely on real estate collateral
to grant credit. As noted in section III.C.2.e of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, for purposes of the
proposal, ‘‘secured by collateral in the form of real
estate’’ in the context of the proposed real estate
exposure definition should be interpreted in a
manner that is consistent with the current
definition for ‘‘a loan secured by real estate’’ in the
Call Report and FR Y–9C instructions.
Question 43: What clarifications or
changes, if any, should the agencies
consider to differentiate project finance
exposures from exposures secured by
real estate? What, if any, capital market
effects would the proposed treatment of
project finance exposures have and why
and what, if any, modifications should
the agencies consider to address such
effects? How material for banking
organizations are project finance
exposures that are not based on the
creditworthiness of a Federal, state or
local government?
3. Off-Balance Sheet Exposures
In addition to on-balance sheet
exposures, banking organizations are
exposed to credit risk associated with
off-balance sheet exposures. Banking
organizations often enter into
contractual arrangements with
borrowers or counterparties to provide
credit or other support. Such
arrangements generally are not recorded
on-balance sheet under GAAP. These
off-balance sheet exposures often
include commitments, contingent items,
guarantees, certain repo-style
transactions, financial standby letters of
credit, and forward agreements.
The proposal would introduce a few
updated credit conversion factors that a
banking organization would apply to an
off-balance sheet item’s notional amount
(typically, the contractual amount) in
order to calculate the exposure amount
for an off-balance sheet exposure. Under
the proposal, the credit conversion
factors, which would range from 10
percent to 100 percent, would reflect the
expected proportion of the off-balance
sheet item that would become an on-
balance sheet credit exposure to the
borrower, taking into account the
contractual features of the off-balance
sheet item. For example, a guarantee
provided by a banking organization
would be subject to a 100 percent credit
conversion factor because there
generally is a high probability of the full
amount of the guarantee becoming an
on-balance sheet credit exposure. In
contrast, under the terms of most
commitments, banking organizations
generally are not expected to extend the
full amount of credit agreed to in the
contract. After determining the off-
balance sheet exposure amount, the
banking organization would then
multiply it by the appropriate risk
weight, as provided under section
III.C.2. of the SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION, to arrive at the risk-
weighted asset amount for the off-
balance sheet exposure, consistent with
the calculation method under the
current standardized approach.
a. Commitments
64055
The proposal would maintain the
existing definition of commitment
under the current capital rule. The
current capital rule defines a
commitment as any legally binding
arrangement that obligates a banking
organization to extend credit or to
purchase assets.99 A commitment can
exist even when the banking
organization has the unilateral right to
not extend credit at any time.
Off-balance sheet exposures such as
credit cards allow obligors to borrow up
to a specified amount. However, some
off-balance sheet exposures such as
charge cards do not have an explicit
contractual pre-set credit limit and
generally require obligors to pay their
balance in full each month. For
commitments with no express
contractual maximum amount or pre-set
limit, the proposal would include an
approach to calculate a proxy for the
committed but undrawn amount of the
commitment (off-balance sheet notional
amount), based on an averaging formula
over the previous two years (averaging
methodology). A banking organization
would first calculate the average total
drawn amount of the commitment over
the prior eight quarters or, if the banking
organization has offered such products
to the obligor for fewer than eight
quarters, the average total drawn
amount since the commitment with no
pre-set limit was first issued. The
banking organization would then
multiply the average total drawn
amount by 10 to determine the off-
balance sheet notional amount. Next,
the banking organization would
determine the applicable off-balance
sheet exposure amount by first
subtracting the current drawn amount
from the calculated off-balance sheet
notional amount and then multiplying
this difference by the applicable credit
conversion factor (10 percent for an
unconditionally cancelable
commitment, as described in more
detail in the following section). The
risk-weighted asset amount would be
the off-balance sheet exposure amount
multiplied by the applicable risk weight
(e.g., 55 percent for a transactor retail
exposure).
For example, assume an obligor’s
charge card had an average drawn
amount of $4,000 over the prior eight
quarters, and a drawn amount of $3,000
during the most recent reporting
quarter. To determine the off-balance
sheet exposure amount of the charge
card, a banking organization would (1)
multiply the average of $4,000 by 10

($40,000), (2) subtract the current drawn
amount of $3,000 from $40,000
($37,000), and (3) multiply $37,000 by
the 10 percent credit conversion factor
for unconditionally cancellable
commitments ($3,700). For purposes of
this example, assume the obligor’s
charge card would qualify as a
regulatory retail exposure 100 that is a
transactor exposure. Applying the 55
percent risk weight for transactor
exposures to the exposure amount of
$3,700. would result in a risk-weighted
asset amount of $2,035.
The proposed averaging methodology
would apply a multiplier of 10 to the
average total drawn amount because
supervisory experience suggests that
obligors similar to those with charge
cards have average credit utilization
rates equal to approximately 10 percent.
This approach uses an eight-quarter
average balance, as opposed to a shorter
period, to better reflect a borrower’s
credit usage, notably by mitigating the
impact of seasonality and of short-term
trends in drawn balances from the total
credit exposure estimate.
Question 44: What are the advantages
and disadvantages of the averaging
methodology to calculate a proxy for the
undrawn credit exposure amount for
commitments with no pre-set limits?
What, if any, adjustments should the
agencies consider to better reflect a
borrower’s credit usage when
calculating the undrawn portion of the
credit exposures for commitments that
have less than eight quarters of data,
particularly those with less than a full
quarter of data? What, if any, alternative
approaches should the agencies
consider and why?
Question 45: What adjustments, if
any, should the agencies make to the
proposed multiplier of 10 for calculating
the total off-balance sheet notional
amount of the obligor under the
proposed methodology and why?
b. Credit Conversion Factors
The proposal would provide the same
credit conversion factors in the current
capital rule except with respect to
commitments. The proposal would
modify the credit conversion factors
applicable to commitments and simplify
the treatment relative to the current
standardized approach by no longer
differentiating such factors by maturity.
Under the proposal, a commitment,
regardless of the maturity of the facility,
would be subject to a credit conversion
factor of 40 percent, except for the
100As discussed in section III.C.2.f of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, a retail exposure
would need to meet certain criteria and be
evaluated against the aggregate and granularity
limits to qualify as a regulatory retail exposure.
unused portion of a commitment that is
unconditionally cancelable 101 (to the
extent permitted under applicable law)
by the banking organization, which
would be subject to a credit conversion
factor of 10 percent.102 Although
unconditionally cancellable
commitments allow banking
organizations to cancel such
commitments at any time without prior
notice, in practice, banking
organizations often extend credit or
provide funding for reputational reasons
or to support the viability of borrowers
to which the banking organization has
significant ongoing exposure, even
when borrowers are under economic
stress. For example, banking
organizations may have incentives to
preserve substantial or core customer
relationships when there is a
deterioration in creditworthiness that
may, for less substantial customer
relationships, cause the banking
organization to cancel a commitment.
Relative to the current standardized
approach, the proposal would simplify
the applicable credit conversion factor
for all other commitments given the 10
percent applicable credit conversion
factor for unconditionally cancellable
commitments. A 40 percent credit
conversion factor for other
commitments is appropriate because
such commitments do not provide the
banking organization the same
flexibility to exit the commitment
compared with unconditionally
cancellable commitments.
Question 46: What additional factors,
if any, should the agencies consider for
determining the applicable credit
conversion factors for commitments?
4. Derivatives
The current capital rule requires
banking organizations to calculate risk-
weighted assets based on the exposure
amount of their derivative contracts and
prescribes different approaches for
measuring the exposure amount of
derivative contracts based on the size
and risk profile of the banking
organization. The proposal would
expand the scope of banking
organizations that would be required to
use one of the approaches, SA–CCR,
which was adopted in January 2020 (the
101Under §ll. 2 of the current capital rule,
unconditionally cancelable means a commitment
that a banking organization may, at any time, with
or without cause, refuse to extend credit (to the
extent permitted under applicable law). See 12 CFR
3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board); 12 CFR 324.2
(FDIC).
102Under the proposal, a 40 percent CCF would
also apply to commitments that are not
unconditionally cancelable commitments for
purposes of calculating total leverage exposure for
the supplementary leverage ratio.
SA–CCR final rule),103 and make certain
technical revisions to that approach.
The current capital rule requires
banking organizations subject to
Category I or II capital standards to
utilize SA–CCR or the internal models
methodology to calculate their advanced
approaches total risk-weighted assets
and to utilize SA–CCR to calculate
standardized total risk-weighted
assets.104 The current capital rule
permits banking organizations subject to
Category III or IV capital standards to
utilize the current exposure
methodology or SA–CCR to calculate
standardized total risk-weighted
assets.105
As discussed in section II of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, the
proposal would require institutions
subject to Category III or IV capital
standards to use the expanded risk-
based approach, which includes the
requirement to use SA–CCR, and would
eliminate the internal models
methodology as an available approach
to calculate the exposure amount of
derivative contracts. Therefore, under
the proposal, large banking
organizations would be required to use
SA–CCR to calculate regulatory capital
ratios under the standardized approach,
expanded risk-based approach, and
supplementary leverage ratio.
The agencies are also proposing
technical revisions to SA–CCR to assist
banking organizations in implementing
SA–CCR in a consistent manner and
with an exposure measurement that
more appropriately reflects the
counterparty credit risks posed by
derivative transactions.
a. Proposed Technical Revisions
i. Treatment of Collateral Held by a
Qualifying Central Counterparty (QCCP)
Under the current capital rule, a
clearing member banking organization
using SA–CCR must determine its
capital requirement for a default fund
contribution to a QCCP based on the
hypothetical capital requirement for the
QCCP (KCCP) using SA–CCR.106 The
calculation of KCCP requires calculating
the exposure amount of the QCCP to
each of its clearing members. In the
calculation of the exposure amount, the
SA–CCR final rule allows the exposure
amount of the QCCP to each clearing
member to be reduced by all collateral
held by the QCCP posted by the clearing
member and by the amount of

prefunded default fund contributions
provided by the clearing member to the
QCCP. However, this treatment is
inconsistent with the calculation of the
exposure amount for a netting set, in
which collateral is not subtracted from
the exposure amount but is instead a
component of the calculations of both
the replacement cost (RC) and potential
future exposure (PFE).
The proposal would change how
collateral posted to a QCCP by clearing
members and the amount of clearing
members’ prefunded default fund
contributions factor into the calculation
of KCCP. This treatment, which is more
sensitive to the risk-reducing benefits of
collateral, would allow the proper
recognition of collateral in calculating
the exposure amount of a QCCP to its
clearing members and would be
consistent with the calculation of the
exposure amount for a netting set.
Specifically, for the purpose of
calculating the exposure amount of a
QCCP to a clearing member, the net
independent collateral amount that
appears in the RC and PFE calculations
would be replaced by the sum of:
(1) the fair value amount of the
independent collateral posted to a QCCP
by a clearing member;
. 
(2) the fair value amount of the
independent collateral posted to a QCCP
by a clearing member on behalf of a
client, in connection with derivative
contracts for which the clearing member
has provided a guarantee to the QCCP;
and
(3) the amount of the prefunded
default fund contribution of the clearing
member to the QCCP.
Both the amount of independent
collateral and the prefunded default
fund contribution would be adjusted by
the standard supervisory haircuts under
Table 1 to §.121 of the proposal, as
applicable.
ii. Treatment of Collateral Held in a
Bankruptcy-Remote Manner
Both the standardized approach and
the advanced approaches under the
current capital rule require a banking
organization to determine the trade
exposure amount for derivative
contracts transacted through a central
counterparty (CCP).
When calculating its trade exposure
amount for a cleared transaction, a
banking organization under both the
standardized and advanced approaches
under the capital rule may exclude
collateral posted to the CCP that is held
in a bankruptcy-remote manner by the
.
CCP
64057
or a custodian. In the SA–CCR final
rule, the agencies inadvertently imposed
heightened requirements for the
exclusion of collateral from the trade
exposure amount posted by a clearing
member banking organizations to a CCP
under the advanced approaches.107 The
expanded risk-based approach does not
include these heightened requirements
and would align the requirements for
the exclusion of collateral from the trade
exposure amount of banking
organizations under both the
standardized and expanded risk-based
approach.
iii. Supervisory Delta for Collateralized
Debt Obligation (CDO) Tranches
Under the SA–CCR final rule, a
banking organization must apply a
supervisory delta adjustment to account
for the sensitivity of a derivative
contract (scaled to unit size) to the
underlying primary risk factor,
including the correct sign (positive or
negative) to account for the direction of
the derivative contract amount relative
to the primary risk factor.108
For a derivative contract that is a CDO
tranche, the supervisory delta
adjustment is calculated using the
formula below:
where A is the attachment point and D
is the detachment point.
The SA–CCR final rule applies a
positive sign to the resulting amount if
the banking organization purchased the
CDO tranche and applies a negative sign
if the banking organization sold the
CDO tranche. However, the appropriate
sign to account for the purchasing or
selling of CDO tranches can be
ambiguous: purchasing a CDO tranche
can be interpreted as selling credit
protection, while selling a CDO tranche
can be interpreted as purchasing credit
protection. In order to ensure the correct
sign of the supervisory delta adjustment
for CDO tranches that would result in a
proper aggregation of CDO tranches
with linear credit derivative contracts in
PFE calculations, the proposal would
revise the sign specification for the
supervisory delta adjustment for CDO
tranches as follows: positive if the CDO
tranches were used to purchase credit
107 12 CFR 3.133(c)(4)(i) (OCC); 12 CFR
217.133(c)(4)(i) (Board); 12 CFR 324.133(c)(4)(i)
(FDIC).
108For the supervisory delta adjustment, a
banking organization applies a positive sign to the
protection by the banking organization
and negative if the CDO tranches were
used to sell credit protection by the
banking organization.
iv. Supervisory Delta for Options
Contracts
Under the SA–CCR final rule, the
supervisory delta adjustment for option
contracts is calculated based on the
Black-Scholes formulas for delta
sensitivity of European call and put
option contracts. The original Black-
Scholes formula for a European option
contract’s delta sensitivity assumes a
lognormal probability distribution for
the value of the instrument or risk factor
underlying the option contract, thus
precluding negative values for both the
current value of the underlying
instrument or risk factor and the strike
price of the option contract. The SA–
CCR final rule uses modified Black-
Scholes formulas that are based on a
shifted lognormal probability
derivative contract amount if the derivative contract
is long the risk factor and a negative sign if the
derivative contract is short the risk factor. A
derivative contract is long the primary risk factor
if the fair value of the instrument increases when
distribution, which allows negative
values of the underlying instrument or
risk factor with the magnitude not
exceeding the value of a shift parameter
l (lambda). The SA–CCR final rule sets
l to zero (thus precluding negative
values) for all asset classes except the
interest rate asset class, which has
exhibited negative values in some
currencies in recent years. For the
interest rate asset class, a banking
organization must set the value of l for
a given currency equal to the greater of
(i) the negative of the lowest value of the
strike prices and the current values of
the interest rate underlying all interest
rate options in a given currency that the
banking organization has with all
counterparties plus 0.1 percent; and (ii)
zero.
However, negative values of the
instrument or risk factor underlying an
option contract can occur in other asset
classes as well. For example, whenever
the value of the primary risk factor increases. A
derivative contract is short the primary risk factor
if the fair value of the instrument decreases when
the value of the primary risk factor increases.

an option contract references the
difference between the values of two
instruments or risk factors, the
underlying spread of this option
contract can be negative. Such option
contracts are commonly traded in the
OTC derivatives market, including
option contracts on the spread between
two commodity prices and on the
difference in performance across two
equity indices. Under the current capital
rule, banking organizations cannot
calculate the supervisory delta
adjustment for any option contract other
than an interest rate derivative contract
if the strike price or the current value of
the underlying instrument or risk factor
is negative because the SA–CCR final
rule only allows a non-zero value for l
for interest rate derivative contracts. To
ensure that a banking organization is
able to calculate the supervisory delta
adjustment for option contracts when
the underlying instrument or risk factor
has a negative value, the proposal
would extend the use of the shift
parameter l to all asset classes. More
specifically, for non-interest-rate asset
classes, the proposal would require a
banking organization to use the same
value of l for all option contracts that
reference the same underlying
instrument or risk factor. If the value of
the underlying instrument or risk factor
cannot be negative, the value of l would
be set to zero. Otherwise, to determine
the value of l for a given risk factor or
instrument, the proposal would require
a banking organization to find the
lowest value L of the strike price and the
current value of the underlying
instrument or risk factor of all option
contracts that reference this instrument
or risk factor with all counterparties.
The proposal would require a banking
organization to set l for this instrument
or risk factor according to the formula
l=max{¥1.1·L,0}. The purpose of
multiplying negative L by 1.1 (thus,
resulting in ¥1.1·L) is the same as that
for adding 0.1 percent in the case of
interest rate derivative contracts under
the SA–CCR final rule: to set the lowest
possible value of the underlying
instrument or risk factor slightly below
the lowest observed value. Because it is
challenging to determine a universal
additive offset value for all values of
non-interest-rate instruments and risk
factors, the offset would be performed
via multiplication for asset classes other
than the interest rate asset class.
The proposal would also permit a
banking organization, with the approval
of its primary Federal supervisor, to
specify a different value for l for
purposes of the supervisory delta
adjustment for option contracts other
than interest rate option contracts, if a
different value for l would be
appropriate, considering the range of
values for the instrument or risk factor
underlying option contracts. This
flexibility would allow a banking
organization to use a specific value for
l, rather than the value resulting from
the proposed formula described above,
in the event that a different value for l
is more appropriate than the value
resulting from the formula. A banking
organization that specifies a different
value for l would be required to assign
the same value for l to all option
contracts with the same underlying
instrument or risk factor, as applicable,
with all counterparties. This proposed
provision is intended to permit a
banking organization, with approval
from its primary Federal supervisor, to
account for unanticipated outcomes in
the supervisory delta adjustment of
certain asset classes while avoiding
arbitrage between assets in that class.
Question 47: What other approaches
should the agencies consider to
calibrate the lambda parameter for non-
interest-rate asset classes, such as a
formula that is different from the
proposed formula of l=max{¥1.1·L,0},
and why? What values besides 1.1, if
any,
should the agencies consider for
the value of the multiplier in the
proposed formula? Why?
v. Decomposition of Credit, Equity, and
Commodity Indices
Under the capital rule, banking
organizations are permitted to
decompose indices within credit,
equity, and commodity asset classes,
such that a banking organization would
treat each component of the index as a
separate single-name derivative
contract.109 The capital rule requires
that if a banking organization elects to
decompose indices within the credit,
equity, and commodity asset classes, the
banking organization must perform all
calculations in determining the
exposure amount based on the
underlying instrument rather than the
index. While this is possible for linear
indices, for non-linear index contracts
(e.g., those with optionality and CDS
index tranches) it is not mathematically
possible to calculate the supervisory
delta for an underlying component, as
the delta associated with the non-linear
index applies at the instrument level. In
recognition of this fact, the agencies are
clarifying that the option to decompose
a non-linear index is not available under
SA–CCR. Additionally, the agencies are
109See 12 CFR 3.132(c)(5)(vi) (OCC); 12 CFR
217.132(c)(5)(vi) (Board); 12 CFR 324.132(c)(5)(vi)
(FDIC)..
clarifying that if electing to decompose
a linear index, banking organizations
must apply the weights used by the
index when determining the exposure
amounts for the underlying instrument.
5. Credit Risk Mitigation
The current capital rule permits
banking organizations to recognize
certain types of credit risk mitigants,
such as guarantees, credit derivatives,
and collateral, for risk-based capital
purposes provided the credit risk
mitigants satisfy the qualification
standards under the rule.110 Credit
derivatives and guarantees can reduce
the credit risk of an exposure by placing
a legal obligation on a third-party
protection provider to compensate the
banking organization for losses in the
event of a borrower default.111
Similarly, the use of collateral can
reduce the credit risk of an exposure by
creating the right of a banking
organization to take ownership of and
liquidate the collateral in the event of a
default by the counterparty. Prudent use
of such mitigants can help a banking
organization reduce the credit risk of an
exposure and thereby reduce the risk-
based capital requirement associated
with that exposure.
Credit risk mitigants recognized for
risk-based capital purposes must be of
sufficiently high quality to effectively
reduce credit risk. For guarantees and
credit derivatives, the current capital
rule primarily looks to the
creditworthiness of the guarantor and
the features of the underlying contract
to determine whether these forms of
credit risk mitigation may be recognized
for risk-based capital purposes (eligible
guarantee or eligible credit derivative).
With respect to collateralized
transactions, the current capital rule
primarily looks to the liquidity profile
and quality of the collateral received
and the nature of the banking
organization’s security interest to
determine whether the collateral
qualifies as financial collateral that may
be recognized for purposes of risk-based
capital.112
As stated earlier, the proposal would
eliminate the use of models for credit
risk under the current capital rule.
110Consistent with the current capital rule, the
proposal would not require banking organizations
to recognize any instrument as a credit risk
mitigant. Credit derivatives that a banking
organization cannot or chooses not to recognize as
a credit risk mitigant would be subject to a separate
counterparty credit risk capital requirement.
111Credit events are defined in the documents
governing the credit risk mitigant and often include
events such as failure to pay principal and interest
and entry into insolvency or similar proceedings.
112See 12 CFR 3.2, 217.2, and 324.2 for the
definition of financial collateral.

Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 179 / Monday, September 18, 2023 / Proposed Rules
Therefore, the proposal would replace
certain methodologies for recognizing
the risk-reducing benefits of financial
collateral and eligible guarantees and
credit derivatives—namely, the internal
models methodology, simple VaR
approach, PD substitution approach,
LGD adjustment approach, and double
default treatment—with the
standardized approaches described
below. For eligible guarantees and
eligible credit derivatives, the proposal
would permit banking organizations to
use the substitution approach from
subpart D of the current capital rule
with a modification for eligible credit
derivatives that do not include
restructuring as a credit event. Further,
the proposal would no longer permit the
recognition of credit protection from
nth-to-default credit derivatives.113 For
all collateralized transactions, the
corporate issuer of any financial
collateral in the form of a corporate debt
security must have an outstanding
publicly traded security or the corporate
issuer must be controlled by a company
that has an outstanding publicly traded
security in order to be recognized. For
collateralized transactions where
financial collateral secures exposures
that are not derivative contracts or
netting sets of derivative contracts, the
proposal would permit banking
organizations to use the simple
approach from subpart D without any
modification. For eligible margin loans
and repo-style transactions, the proposal
would also permit banking
organizations to use the collateral
haircut approach with standard
supervisory market price volatility
haircuts 114 from subpart D with two
proposed modifications to increase risk
sensitivity: (1) adjustments to the
market price volatility haircuts and (2)
a modified formula for netting sets of
eligible margin loans or repo-style
transactions that reflects netting and
diversification benefits within netting
sets. Finally, the proposal would
introduce minimum haircut floors for
certain eligible margin loan and
repo-
style transactions with unregulated
financial institutions that banking
organizations must meet in order to
recognize the risk-mitigation benefits of
financial collateral.
113See section III.D.3.a of this SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION.
114Under subpart D, banking organizations also
are permitted to use their own estimates of market
price volatility haircuts, with prior written approval
from the primary Federal supervisors. The proposal
would not include this option in subpart E as the
agencies have found it to introduce unwarranted
variability in banking organizations’ risk-weighted
assets.
In connection with the removal of the
internal models methodology, the
proposal would make corresponding
revisions to reflect this change in the
definition of a netting set. Compared to
the current capital rule, the proposal
would exclude cross-product netting
sets from the definition of a netting set,
as none of the proposed approaches
under the revised framework would
recognize cross-product netting. This
would be consistent with the current
capital rule, which also does not
recognize cross-product netting.
Therefore, the proposal would define a
netting set as a group of single-product
transactions with a single counterparty
that are subject to a qualifying master
netting agreement (QMNA) 115 and that
consist only of one of the following:
derivative contracts, repo-style
transactions, or eligible margin loans.
For purposes of the proposed netting set
definition, the netting set must include
the same product (i.e., all derivative
contracts or all repo-style transactions
or all eligible margin loans). Consistent
with the current capital rule, for
derivative contracts, the proposed
definition of netting set would also
include a single derivative contract
between a banking organization and a
single counterparty.
Question 48: What would be the
impact of requiring that certain debt
securities must be issued by a publicly-
traded company, or issued by a
company controlled by a publicly-
traded company, in order to qualify as
financial collateral and what, if any,
alternatives should the agencies
consider to this requirement?
a. Guarantees and Credit Derivatives
i. Substitution Approach
As under subpart D in the current
capital rule, under the proposal a
banking organization would be
permitted to recognize the credit-risk-
mitigation benefits of eligible guarantees
and eligible credit derivatives by
substituting the risk weight applicable
to the eligible guarantor or protection
provider for the risk weight applicable
to the hedged exposure.116
ii. Adjustment for Credit Derivatives
Without Restructuring as a Credit Event
Credit derivative contracts in certain
jurisdictions include debt restructuring
as a credit event that triggers a payment
obligation by the protection provider to
115See 12 CFR 3.2, 217.2, and 324.2 for the
definition of qualifying master netting agreement.
116Under subpart E in the current capital rule, an
eligible guarantee need not be issued by an eligible
guarantor unless the exposure is a securitization
exposure. The proposal would require all eligible
guarantees to be issued by an eligible guarantor.
64059
the protection purchaser. Such
restructurings of the hedged exposure
may involve forgiveness or
postponement of principal, interest, or
fees that result in a loss to investors.
Consistent with the current capital rule,
the proposal would generally require a
banking organization that seeks to
recognize the credit risk-mitigation
benefits of an eligible credit derivative
that does not include a restructuring of
the reference exposure as a credit event
to reduce the effective notional amount
of the credit derivative by 40 percent to
account for any unmitigated losses that
could occur as a result of a restructuring
of the hedged exposure.
Under the proposal, however, the 40
percent adjustment would not apply to
eligible credit derivatives without
restructuring as a credit event if both of
the following requirements are satisfied:
(1) the terms of the hedged exposure
(and the reference exposure, if different
from the hedged exposure) allow the
maturity, principal, coupon, currency,
or seniority status to be amended
outside of receivership, insolvency,
liquidation, or similar proceeding only
by unanimous consent of all parties; and
(2) the banking organization has
conducted sufficient legal review to
conclude with a well-founded basis
(and maintains sufficient written
documentation of that legal review) that
the hedged exposure is subject to the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or a domestic or
foreign insolvency regime with similar
features that allows for a company to
reorganize or restructure and provides
for an orderly settlement of creditor
claims.
The unanimous consent requirement
would mean that, for restructurings
occurring outside of an insolvency
proceeding, all holders of the hedged
exposure (and the reference exposure, if
different from the hedged exposure)
must agree to any restructuring for the
restructuring to occur, and no holder
can vote against the restructuring or
abstain. This unanimous consent
requirement would reduce the risk that
a banking organization would suffer a
credit loss on the hedged exposure that
would not be offset by a payment under
the eligible credit derivative. Banking
organizations generally would only be
incentivized to vote for a restructuring
if the terms of the restructuring would
provide a more beneficial outcome to
the banking organization relative to
insolvency proceedings that would
trigger payment under the eligible credit
derivative. Additionally, the unanimous
consent requirement for the reference
exposure, if different from the hedged
exposure, would add an additional layer
of security by significantly reducing the

probability of reaching a restructuring
agreement that results in a loss of
principal or interest for creditors
without triggering payment under the
eligible credit derivative. The
unanimous consent requirement would
need to be satisfied through the terms of
the hedged exposure (and the reference
exposure, if different from the hedged
exposure), which could be
accomplished through a contractual
provision of the exposure or the
application of law.
The requirement that the hedged
exposure be subject to the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code or a similar domestic
or foreign insolvency regime would help
to ensure that any restructuring is done
in an orderly, predictable, and regulated
process. In the event that the obligor of
the hedged exposure defaults and the
default is not cured, the obligor would
either be required to enter insolvency
proceedings, which would trigger
payment under the credit derivative, or
the obligor would be required to pursue
restructuring outside of insolvency,
which could not occur without the
banking organization’s consent.
Together, the proposed requirements
would ensure that credit derivatives that
do not include restructuring as a credit
event but provide similarly effective
protection as those that do contain such
provisions, are afforded similar
recognition under the capital
framework.
Question 49: The agencies seek
comment on the appropriateness of
allowing banking organizations to
recognize in full the effective notional
amount of credit derivatives that do not
include restructuring as a credit event,
if certain conditions are met. Is the
exemption from the 40 percent haircut
overly broad? If so, why, and how might
the exemption be narrowed to only
capture the types of credit derivatives
that provide protection similar to credit
derivatives that include restructuring as
a credit event?
Question 50: To what extent is the
proposed treatment of eligible credit
derivatives that do not include
restructuring of the reference exposure
as a credit event relevant outside of the
United States?
b. Collateralized Transactions
The proposal would only allow a
banking organization to recognize the
risk-mitigating benefits of a corporate
debt security that meets the definition of
financial collateral in expanded risk-
weighted assets if the corporate issuer of
the debt security has a publicly traded
security outstanding or is controlled by
a company that has a publicly traded
security outstanding. Corporations with
publicly traded securities typically are
subject to mandatory regulatory and
public reporting and disclosure
requirements, and therefore debt
securities issued by such corporations
may be a more stable and liquid form of
collateral.
i. Simple Approach
Subpart D of the current capital rule
includes the simple approach, which
allows a banking organization to
recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of
financial collateral received by
substituting the risk weight applicable
to an exposure with the risk weight
applicable to the financial collateral
securing the exposure, generally subject
to a 20 percent floor. The proposal
generally would maintain the simple
approach of the current capital rule,
including restrictions on collateral
eligibility and the risk-weight floor,
except for the proposed requirement for
certain corporate debt securities.
ii. Collateral Haircut Approach
Under the current capital rule, a
banking organization may recognize the
credit risk-mitigation benefits of repo-
style transactions, eligible margin loans,
and netting sets of such transactions by
adjusting its exposure amount to its
counterparty to recognize any financial
collateral received and any collateral
posted to the counterparty. Subpart E of
the current capital rule includes several
approaches that a banking organization
may use and some of those approaches
include the use of models that
contribute to variability in risk-weighted
assets. For this reason, under the
proposal a banking organization would
no longer be allowed to use the simple
VaR approach or the internal models
methodology to calculate the exposure
amount, nor would a banking
organization be permitted to use its own
internal estimates for calculating
haircuts. The proposal would broadly
retain the collateral haircut approach
with standard supervisory market
volatility haircuts with some
modifications. This approach would
require a banking organization to adjust
the fair value of the collateral received
and posted to account for any potential
market price volatility in the value of
the collateral during the margin period
of risk, as well as to address any
differences in currency. To increase the
risk-sensitivity of the collateral haircut
approach, the proposal would modify
certain market price volatility haircuts.
The proposal would also introduce a
new method to calculate the exposure
amount of eligible transactions in a
netting set and simplify the existing
exposure calculation method for
individual transactions that are not part
of a netting set.
I. Exposure Amount
The proposal would provide two
methods for calculating the exposure
amount under the collateral haircut
approach for eligible margin loans and
repo-style transactions. One method
would apply to individual eligible
margin loans and repo-style
transactions, the other to single-product
netting sets of such transactions, as
described below. The new formula for
netting sets would allow for the
recognition of the risk-mitigating
benefits of netting and portfolio
diversification and is intended to
provide for increased risk-sensitivity of
the capital requirement for such
transactions relative to the current
capital rule.
A. Exposure Amount for Transactions
Not in a Netting Set
Under the collateral haircut approach,
the proposed exposure amount for an
individual eligible margin loan or repo-
style transaction that is not part of a
netting set would yield the same result
as the exposure amount equation in the
current capital rule. However, the
proposal would change the variables
and structure to provide a simplified
calculation for an individual eligible
margin loan or repo-style transaction in
comparison with transactions that are
part of a netting set. Specifically, the
proposal would require a banking
organization to calculate the exposure
amount as the greater of zero and the
difference of the following two
quantities: (1) the value of the exposure,
adjusted by the market price volatility
haircut applicable to the exposure for a
potential increase in the exposure
amount; and (2) the value of the
collateral, adjusted by the market price
volatility haircut applicable to the
collateral for a potential decrease in the
collateral value and the currency
mismatch haircut applicable where the
currency of the collateral is different
from the settlement currency. The
banking organization would use the
market price volatility haircuts and a
standard 8 percent currency mismatch
haircut, subject to adjustments, as
described in the following section.
Specifically, the exposure amount for an
individual eligible margin loan or repo-
style transaction that is not in a netting
set would be based on the following
formula:
E* = max{0; E × (1 + He)¥C ×
(1¥Hc¥Hfx)}

• E* is the exposure amount of the
transaction after credit risk mitigation.
• E is the current fair value of the specific
instrument, cash, or gold the banking
organization has lent, sold subject to
repurchase, or posted as collateral to the

• He is the haircut appropriate to E as
described in Table 1 to §.121, as
applicable.

B. Exposure Amount for Transactions in
a Netting Set
Under the collateral haircut approach,
the proposal would provide a new, more
risk-sensitive equation that recognizes
diversification benefits by taking into
consideration the number of securities
included in a netting set of eligible
margin loans or repo-style transactions.
Under this approach, the exposure
amount for a netting set of eligible
margin loans or repo-style transactions
would equal:
Where:
• E* is the exposure amount of the netting
set after credit risk mitigation.
• Ei is the current fair value of the
instrument, cash, or gold the banking
organization has lent, sold subject to
repurchase, or posted as collateral to the
counterparty.
• Ci is the current fair value of the
instrument, cash, or gold the banking
organization has borrowed, purchased
subject to resale, or taken as collateral
from the counterparty.
• netexposure = |Ss Es Hs|.
• grossexposure = Ss Es |Hs|.
• Es is the absolute value of the net position
in a given instrument or in gold (where
the net position in a given instrument or
gold equals the sum of the current fair
values of the instrument or gold the
banking organization has lent, sold
subject to repurchase, or posted as
collateral to the counterparty, minus the
sum of the current fair values of that
same instrument or gold the banking
organization has borrowed, purchased
subject to resale, or taken as collateral
from the counterparty).
• Hs is the haircut appropriate to Es as
described in Table 1 to §ll.121, as
applicable. Hs has a positive sign if the
instrument or gold is net lent, sold
subject to repurchase, or posted as
collateral to the counterparty; Hs has a
negative sign if the instrument or gold is
net borrowed, purchased subject to
resale, or taken as collateral from the
counterparty.
• N is the number of instruments in the
netting set with a unique Committee on
Uniform Securities Identification
Procedures (CUSIP) designation or
foreign equivalent, with certain
exceptions. N would include any
instrument with a unique CUSIP that the
banking organization lends, sells subject
to repurchase, or posts as collateral, as
well as any instrument with a unique
CUSIP that the banking organization
borrows, purchases subject to resale, or
takes as collateral. However, N would
not include collateral instruments that
the banking organization is not permitted
to include within the credit risk
mitigation framework (such as
nonfinancial collateral that is not part of
a repo-style transaction included in the
banking organization’s market risk
weighted assets) or elects not to include
within the credit risk mitigation
framework. The number of instruments
for N would also not include any
instrument (or gold) for which the value
Es is less than one-tenth of the value of
the largest Es in the netting set. Any
amount of gold would be given a value
of one.
• Efx is the absolute value of the net position
in each currency fx different from the
settlement currency.
• Hfx is the haircut appropriate for currency
mismatch of currency fx.
The first component in the above
formula, (Si Ei¥SiCi) would capture the
baseline exposure of a netting set of
eligible margin loans or repo-style
transactions after accounting for the
value of any collateral. The second, (0.4
× netexposure), and third, (0.6 ×
(grossexposure/√N)) components in the
above formula would reflect the
. 
systematic risk (based on the net
exposure) and the idiosyncratic risk 117
(based on the gross exposure) of the
netting set of eligible margin loans or
repo-style transactions covered by a
QMNA. Under the proposal, the net
exposure component would allow the
formula to recognize netting at the level
of the netting set and correlations in the
movement of market prices for
instruments lent and received.
Additionally, because the contribution
from the gross exposure component to
the exposure amount would decrease
proportionally with an increase in the
number of unique instruments by CUSIP
designations or foreign equivalent, the
gross exposure would capture the
impact of portfolio diversification. The
fourth component, (Sfx (Efx × Hfx)) would
capture any adjustment to reflect
currency mismatch, if applicable.
When determining the market price
volatility and currency mismatch
haircuts, the banking organization
would use the market price volatility
haircuts described in the following
section and a standard 8 percent
currency mismatch haircut, subject to
certain adjustments.

prominently in the instrument’s market
price volatility, as described below.
The proposal would apply haircuts
based solely on residual maturity, rather
than a combination of residual maturity
and underlying risk weight as under the
current capital rule for investment grade
debt securities other than sovereign debt
securities. These haircuts are derived
from observed stress volatilities during
10-business day periods during the 2008
financial crisis. Debt securities with
longer maturities are subject to higher
price volatility from future changes in
both interest rates and the
creditworthiness of the issuer.
Because securitization exposures tend
to be more volatile than corporate
debt,120 the proposal would provide a
distinct category of market price
volatility haircuts for certain
securitization exposures consistent with
the current capital rule. The proposal
would distinguish between non-senior
and senior securitization exposures to
enhance risk sensitivity. Since senior
securitization exposures absorb losses
only after more junior securitization
exposures, these exposures have an
added layer of security and different
market price volatility. Therefore, the
proposal would only specify term-based
haircuts for investment grade senior
securitization exposures that receive a
risk weight of less than 100 percent
under the securitization framework.
Other securitization exposures would
receive the 30 percent market price
volatility haircut applicable to ‘‘other’’
exposure types.
The proposal would require a banking
organization to apply market price
volatility haircuts of 20 percent for main
index equities (including convertible
bonds) and gold, 30 percent for other
publicly traded equities and convertible
bonds, and 30 percent for other
exposure types. Equities in a main index
typically are more liquid than those that
are not included in a main index, as
investors may seek to replicate the
index by purchasing the referenced
equities or engaging in derivative
transactions involving the index or
equities within the index. The lower
haircuts for equities included in a main
index under the proposal would reflect
the higher liquidity of those securities
compared to other publicly traded
equities or exposure types, which would
generally help to reduce losses to
banking organizations when liquidating
those securities during stress
conditions.

For collateral in the form of mutual
fund shares, the proposal would be
consistent with the collateral haircut
approach provided in the current capital
rule in which a banking organization
would apply the highest haircut
applicable to any security in which the
fund can invest. The proposal also
would include an alternative method
available to a banking organization if the
mutual fund qualifies for the full look-
through approach described in section
III.E.1.c.ii. of this SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION. This alternative method
would provide a more risk-sensitive
calculation of the haircut on mutual
fund shares collateral by using the
weighted average of haircuts applicable
to the instruments held by the mutual
fund.121 This aspect of the proposal
reflects the agencies’ observation that,
while certain mutual funds may be
authorized to hold a wide range of
investments, the actual holdings of
mutual funds are often more limited.
In addition, the proposal would
maintain the requirement for a banking
organization to apply a market price
volatility haircut of 30 percent to
address the potential market price
volatility for any instruments that the
banking organization has lent, sold
subject to repurchase, or posted as
collateral that is not of a type otherwise
specified in Table 1 to § ll.121.
Question 53: What are the advantages
and disadvantages of allowing banking
organizations to apply the full look-
through approach for certain collateral
in the form of mutual fund shares? What
alternative approaches should the
agencies consider for banking
organizations to determine the market
price volatility haircuts for collateral in
the form of mutual fund shares?
III. Minimum Haircut Floors for Certain
Eligible Margin Loans and Repo-Style
Transactions
The proposed framework for
minimum haircuts on non-centrally
cleared securities financing transactions
would reflect the risk exposure of
banking organizations to non-bank
financial entities that employ leverage
and engage in maturity transformation
but that are not subject to prudential
regulation.
The absence of prudential regulation
makes such entities more vulnerable to
.
121 If the mutual fund qualifies for the full look-
through approach described in section III.E.1.c.ii of
this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION but would be
treated as a market risk covered position as
described in section III.H.3 of this SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION if the banking organization held the
mutual fund directly, the banking organization is
permitted to apply the alternative method to
calculate the haircut.

runs, leading to an increase in the credit
risk of these entities in the form of a
greater risk of default in stress
periods.122 Episodes of non-bank
financial entities’ distress, such as the
2008 financial crisis, have highlighted
banking organizations’ exposure to non-
bank financial entities through
securities financing transactions, which
may give rise to credit and liquidity
risks.
Securities financing transactions may
include repo-style transactions and
eligible margin loans. The motivation
behind a specific securities financing
transaction can be either to lend or
borrow cash, or to lend or borrow a
security. Securities financing
transactions can be used by a
counterparty to achieve significant
leverage—for example, through
transactions where the primary purpose
is to finance a counterparty through the
lending of cash—and result in elevated
counterparty credit risk.
The proposal would require a banking
organization to receive a minimum
amount of collateral when undertaking
certain repo-style transactions and
eligible margin loans (in-scope
transactions) with such entities
(unregulated financial institutions). The
application of haircut floors would
determine the minimum amount of
collateral exchanged. A banking
organization would treat in-scope
transactions with unregulated financial
institutions that do not meet the
proposed haircut floors as repo-style
transactions or eligible margin loans
where the banking organization did not
receive any collateral from its
counterparty.123 The proposed
treatment is intended to limit the build-
up of excessive leverage outside the
banking system and reduce the
cyclicality of such leverage, thereby
limiting risk to the lending banking
organization and the banking system.
A. Unregulated Financial Institutions
Consistent with the definition in
§ ll. 2 of the current capital rule, the
proposal would define unregulated
financial institution as a financial
institution that is not a regulated
financial institution, including any
122See ‘‘Strengthening Oversight and Regulation
of Shadow Banking,’’ Financial Stability Board,
August 2013 https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/
uploads/r_130829b.pdf.
123 In this example, the banking organization
would be permitted to calculate the exposure
amount using the collateral haircut approach but
would be required to exclude any collateral
received from the calculation. Alternatively, the
banking organization could choose not to use the
collateral haircut approach but to risk weight any
on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet portions of the
exposure as demonstrated in the example below.

financial institution that would meet the
definition of ‘‘financial institution’’
under §.2 of the current capital rule
but for the ownership interest
thresholds set forth in paragraph (4)(i) of
that definition. Unregulated financial
institutions would include hedge funds
and private equity firms. This definition
would capture non-bank financial
entities that employ leverage and engage
in maturity transformation but that are
not subject to prudential regulation.
Question 54: What entities should be
included or excluded from the scope of
entities subject to the minimum haircut
floors and why? For example, what
would be the advantages and
disadvantages of expanding the
definition of entities that are scoped-in
to include all counterparties, or all
counterparties other than QCCPs? What
impact would expanding the scope of
entities subject to the minimum haircut
floors have on banking organizations’
business models, competitiveness, or
ability to intermediate in funding
markets and in U.S. Treasury securities
markets?
B. In-Scope Transactions
Under the proposal, an in-scope
transaction generally would include the
following non-centrally cleared
transactions: (1) an eligible margin loan
or a repo-style transaction in which a
banking organization lends cash to an
unregulated financial institution in
exchange for securities, unless all of the
securities are non-defaulted sovereign
exposures, and (2) certain security-for-
security repo-style transactions that are
collateral upgrade transactions with an
unregulated financial institution. Under
the proposal, a collateral upgrade
transaction would include a transaction
in which the banking organization lends
one or more securities that, in aggregate,
are subject to a lower haircut floor in
Table 2 to §ll.121 than the securities
received from the unregulated financial
institution.
The proposal would exempt the
following types of transactions and
netting sets of such transactions with
unregulated financial institutions from
the minimum haircut floor
requirements: (1) transactions in which
an unregulated financial institution
lends, sells subject to repurchase, or
posts as collateral securities to a
banking organization in exchange for
cash and the unregulated financial
institution reinvests the cash at the
same or a shorter maturity than the
original transaction with the banking
organization; (2) collateral upgrade
transactions in which the unregulated
financial institution is unable to re-
hypothecate, or contractually agrees that
it will not re-hypothecate, the securities
it receives as collateral; or (3)
transactions in which a banking
organization borrows securities from an
unregulated financial institution for the
purpose of meeting current or
anticipated demand, such as for
delivery obligations, customer demand,
or segregation requirements, and not to
provide financing to the unregulated
financial institution. For transactions
that are cash-collateralized in which an
unregulated financial institution lends
securities to the banking organization,
banking organizations could rely on
representations made by the
unregulated financial institution as to
whether the unregulated financial
institution reinvests the cash at the
same or a shorter maturity than the
maturity of the transaction. For
transactions in which a banking
organization is seeking to borrow
securities from an unregulated financial
institution to meet a current or
anticipated demand, banking
organizations must maintain sufficient
written documentation that such
transactions are for the purpose of
meeting a current or anticipated
demand and not for providing financing
to an unregulated financial institution.
The proposal would exclude these in-
scope
transactions from the minimum
haircut floors as these transactions do
not pose the same credit and liquidity
risks as other in-scope transactions and
serve as important liquidity and
intermediation services provided by
banking organizations.
Question 55: What alternative
definitions of ‘‘in-scope transactions’’
should the agencies consider? For
example, what would be the pros and
cons of an expanded definition of ‘‘in-
scope transactions’’ to include all
eligible margin loan or repo-style
transactions in which a banking
organization lends cash, including those
involving sovereign exposures as
collateral? How would the inclusion of
sovereign exposures affect the market
for those securities? What, if any,
additional factors should the agencies
consider concerning this alternative
definition?
Question 56: What, if any, difficulties
would banking organizations have in
identifying transactions that would be
exempt from the minimum haircut
floor?
Question 57: What, if any, operational
burdens would be imposed by the
proposal to require banking
organizations to maintain sufficient
written documentation to exempt
transactions with an unregulated
financial institution where the banking
organization is seeking to borrow
securities from an unregulated financial
institution to meet a current or
anticipated demand?
C. Application of the Minimum Haircut
Floors
For in-scope transactions, the
proposal would establish minimum
haircut floors that would be applied on
a single-transaction or a portfolio basis
depending on whether the in-scope
transaction is part of a netting set. The
proposed haircut floors are derived from
observed historical price volatilities as
well as existing market and central bank
haircut conventions. If the in-scope
transaction is a single transaction, then
the banking organization would apply
the corresponding single-transaction
haircut floor. If the in-scope transaction
is part of a netting set, the banking
organization would apply a portfolio-
based floor to the entire netting set.124
In-scope transactions that do not meet
the applicable minimum haircut floor
would be treated as uncollateralized
exposures.
The minimum haircut floors are
intended to reflect the minimum
amount of collateral banking
organizations should receive when
undertaking in-scope transactions with
unregulated financial institutions.
Banking organizations should require an
appropriate amount of collateral to be
provided to account for the risks of the
transaction and counterparty. Figure 1
provides a summary of the process for
determining whether an in-scope
transaction meets the applicable
minimum haircut floor.
BILLING CODE 6210–01–P; 6714–01–P; 4810–33–P
124 If a netting set contains both in-scope and out-
of-scope transactions, the banking organization
would apply a portfolio-based floor for the entire
netting set.

BILLING CODE 6210–01–C; 6714–01–C; 4810–33–C
The proposal would require a banking
organization to compare the haircut (H)
and a single-transaction or portfolio
haircut floor (ƒ), as calculated below, to
determine whether an in-scope
transaction or a netting set of in-scope
transactions meets the relevant floor. If
H is less than f, then the banking
organization may not recognize the risk-
mitigating effects of any financial
collateral that secures the exposure.
For a single cash-lent-for-security in-
scope transaction, H would be defined
as the ratio of the fair value of financial
collateral borrowed, purchased subject
to resale, or taken as collateral from the
counterparty to the fair value of cash
lent, minus one, and ƒ would be the
corresponding haircut applicable to the
collateral in Table 2 to § .121. For
example, for an in-scope transaction in
which a banking organization lends
$100 in cash to an unregulated financial
institution and receives $102 in
investment-grade corporate bonds with
a residual maturity of 10 years as
collateral, the haircut would be
calculated as H = (102/100)¥1 = 2
percent. The single-transaction haircut
floor for an investment grade corporate
bond with a residual maturity of 10
years or less under Table 2 to § .121
would be ƒ= 3 percent Since the haircut
is less than the single-transaction
haircut floor (H = 2 percent < 3 percent
= ƒ), the proposal would not allow the
banking organization to recognize the
risk-mitigating benefits of the collateral
and would require the banking
organization to calculate the exposure
amount of its repo-style transaction or
eligible margin loan as if it had not
received any collateral from its
counterparty.
For a single security-for-security repo-
style transaction, H would be defined as
the ratio of the fair value of financial
collateral borrowed, purchased subject
to resale, or taken as collateral from the
counterparty (B) relative to the fair
value of the financial collateral the
banking organization has lent, sold
subject to repurchase, or posted as

collateral to the counterparty (L), minus
one. The single-transaction haircut floor
(f) of the transaction would incorporate
the corresponding haircut applicable to
the collateral received (fB) and collateral
lent (ƒL) in Table 2 to §ll.121. The
single-transaction haircut floor for the
two types of collateral would be
computed as follows:
The single transaction floor then
would be compared to the haircut of the
transaction, determined as follows:
where CB denotes the fair value of
collateral received and CL the fair value
of collateral lent. For example, for a
securities lending transaction in which
a banking organization lends $100 in
investment grade corporate bonds with
a residual maturity of 10 years (which
correspond to a haircut floor of 3
percent) and receives $102 in main
index equity securities (which
correspond to a haircut floor of 6
percent) as collateral, the haircut would
be:
The single-transaction haircut floor
would be:
Since the haircut is less than the
single-transaction haircut floor (H = 2
percent < 2.9126 percent = ƒ), the
banking organization would not be able
to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits
of the collateral received and would be
required to calculate the exposure
amount of its repo-style transaction or
eligible margin loan as if it had not
received any collateral from its
counterparty.
For a netting set of in-scope
transactions, the haircut floor of the
netting set would be computed as
follows:
In the above formula, (CL) would be
the fair value of the net position in each
security or in cash that is net lent, sold
subject to repurchase, or posted as
collateral to the counterparty; CB is the
fair value of the net position that is net
borrowed, purchased subject to resale,
or taken as collateral from the
counterparty; and ƒL and ƒB would be
the haircut floors for the securities or
cash, as applicable, that are net lent and
net borrowed, respectively.125 This
calculation would be the weighted
average haircut floor of the portfolio.
The portfolio haircut H would be
calculated as:
The portfolio would satisfy the
minimum haircut floor requirement
where the following condition is
satisfied: H ≥ fPortfolio.
If the portfolio does not satisfy the
minimum haircut floor, the banking
organization would not be able to
recognize the risk-mitigating benefits of
the collateral received.
In the following example, there are
two in-scope repo-style transactions that
are in the same netting set: (1) a reverse
repo transaction in which a banking
organization lends $100 in cash to an
unregulated financial institution and
receives $102 in investment grade
corporate bonds with a residual
maturity of 10 years (which correspond
to a haircut floor of 3 percent) as
collateral; and (2) a securities lending
transaction in which a banking
organization lends $100 of different
investment grade corporate bonds also
with a residual maturity of 10 years and
receives $104 in main index equity
securities (which correspond to a
haircut floor of 6 percent) as collateral.
For this set of in-scope repo-style
transactions, the portfolio haircut would
be:
The portfolio haircut floor would be:
The banking organization would be
able to recognize the risk-mitigating
benefits of the collateral received,
because the portfolio haircut is higher
than the portfolio haircut floor:
H = 3 percent > 2.971 percent = fPortfolio)
To calculate the exposure amount for
this transaction, the banking
organization would use the collateral
haircut approach formula in
§ .121(c) and the standard market
price volatility haircuts in Table 1 to
§ ll.121 and set N to 3:
125For a given security or cash, a banking
organization may collect the security or cash in one
transaction and post it in another. Thus, at the
portfolio level, the banking organization may, after
netting across all transactions in the same portfolio,
be either collecting the security or cash (that is, net
borrowed) or posting the security or cash (that is,
net lent).

In a similar example, there are also
two in-scope repo-style transactions that
are in the same netting set: (1) a reverse
repo transaction in which a banking
organization lends $100 in cash to an
unregulated financial institution and
receives $101 in investment grade
corporate bonds with a residual
maturity of 10 years (which correspond
to a haircut floor of 3 percent) as
collateral; and (2) a securities lending
transaction in which a banking
organization lends $100 of different
investment grade corporate bonds and
receives $102 in main index equity
securities (which correspond to a
haircut floor of 6 percent) as collateral.
For this set of in-scope repo-style
transactions, the portfolio haircut would
be:
and the portfolio haircut floor would be:
Since the portfolio haircut is less than
the portfolio haircut floor (H= 1.5
percent < 2.9642 percent = ƒPortfolio), the
banking organization would not be able
to recognize the risk-mitigating benefits
of the collateral received.
Instead, the banking organization
would be required to separately risk-
weight the on-balance sheet and off-
balance sheet portion of each individual
transaction. In this example, assuming
that both individual transactions are
treated as secured borrowings instead of
sales under GAAP, the first transaction
in which a banking organization lends
$100 in cash to an unregulated financial
institution and receives $101 in
investment grade corporate bonds
would result in an on-balance sheet
receivable of $100.126 If the second
transaction is a securities lending
transaction from the perspective of the
banking organization and the banking
organization is permitted to sell or
repledge the equity securities, the
transaction results in an increase in the
banking organization’s balance sheet of
$102 for the equity securities received
from the counterparty. The banking
organization would be required to apply
a 100 percent credit conversion factor
(CCF) to the off-balance sheet exposure
to its counterparty for the return of the
investment grade corporate bonds. In
this case, the off-balance sheet exposure
to the counterparty would be the $100
of lent investment grade corporate
bonds.127 The total exposure amount for
the two transactions would be ($100
receivable + $102 equity exposure +
$100 off-balance sheet exposure) = $302.
126The transaction would also result in credit
(reduction) of $100 cash, but this would have no
impact on the banking organization’s risk-weighted
assets as cash is assigned a 0 percent risk weight
under §ll.111.
127See proposed §.112(b)(5)(iv).
If the banking organization is not
permitted to sell or repledge the equity
securities in the second transaction, or
if that transaction is a securities
borrowing transaction from the
perspective of the banking organization,
the equity securities received by the
banking organization would not be
recognized on the banking
organization’s balance sheet.128 The
banking organization would still be
required to apply a 100 percent CCF to
the off-balance sheet exposure to its
counterparty,129 so the total exposure
amount would be ($100 receivable +
$100 off-balance sheet exposure) =
$200.130
Question 58: What alternative
minimum haircut floors should the
agencies consider and why? What would
be the advantages and disadvantages of
setting the minimum haircuts at a
higher level, such as at the proposed
market price volatility haircuts used for
recognition of collateral for eligible
margin loans and repo-style
transactions, or at levels between the
proposed minimum haircut floors and
the proposed market price volatility
haircuts?
Question 59: Where a banking
organization has exchanged multiple
securities for multiple other securities
under a QMNA with an unregulated
financial institution, what would be the
costs and benefits of providing banking
128 If the transaction is a securities borrowing
transaction from the perspective of the banking
organization, and if the equity securities received
are sold or if the counterparty defaults, the banking
organization would be required to record an
obligation to return the securities.
129See proposed §ll.112(b)(5)(v)
130 In all cases, the $100 of investment grade
corporate bonds the banking organization has lent
would continue to remain on the banking
organization’s balance sheet and the banking
organization would continue to maintain risk-based
capital against these bonds.
organizations the flexibility to apply a
single-transaction haircut floor on a
transaction-by-transaction basis for in-
scope transactions within the netting
set, rather than applying a portfolio-
based floor? Under this approach, each
in-scope transaction within a netting set
would be evaluated separately. Banking
organizations would be permitted to
recognize the risk-mitigation benefits of
collateral for individual transactions
that meet the single-transaction haircut
floor, even if the netting set did not meet
the portfolio-based floor.
Question 60: How can the proposed
formulas used for determining whether
an in-scope transaction or in-scope set
of transactions breaches the minimum
haircut floors be improved or further
clarified?
Question 61: What are the advantages
and disadvantages of the proposed
approach to minimum collateral
haircuts for in-scope transactions with
unregulated financial institutions? How
might the proposal change the behavior
of banking organizations and their
counterparties, including changes in
funding practices and potential
migration of funding transactions to
other counterparties? Commenters are
encouraged to provide data and
supporting analysis.
D. Securitization Framework
The securitization framework is
designed to provide the capital
requirement for exposures that involve
the tranching of credit risk of one or
more underlying financial exposures.
The risk and complexity posed by
securitizations differ relative to direct
exposure to the underlying assets in the
securitization because the credit risk of
those assets is divided into different
levels of loss prioritization using a wide

range of structural mechanisms.131 The
performance of a securitization depends
not only on the structure, but also on
the performance of the underlying assets
and certain parties to the securitization
structure, including the asset servicer
and any liquidity facility provider. The
involvement of these parties makes
securitization exposures susceptible to
additional risks as compared to direct
credit exposures.
The proposed securitization
framework would draw on many
features of the framework in subpart E
of the current capital rule with the
following modifications: (1) additional
operational requirements for synthetic
securitizations; (2) a modified treatment
for resecuritizations that meet the
operational requirements; (3) a new
securitization standardized approach
(SEC–SA), as a replacement to the
supervisory formula approach and
standardized supervisory formula
approach (SSFA), which includes,
relative to the SSFA, modified
definitions of attachment point and
detachment point, a modified definition
of the W parameter, modifications to the
definition of KG, a higher p-factor, a
lower risk-weight floor for securitization
exposures that are not resecuritization
exposures, and a higher risk-weight
floor for resecuritization exposures; (4)
a prohibition on using the securitization
framework for nth-to-default credit
derivatives; (5) a new treatment for
derivative contracts that do not provide
credit enhancement; (6) a modified
treatment for overlapping exposures; (7)

eligibility criteria for certain senior
securitization exposures (the ‘‘look-
through approach’’); (8) a modification
to the treatment for credit-enhancing
interest only strips (CEIOs); and (9) a
new framework for non-performing loan
(NPL) securitizations.132
1. Operational Requirements
The proposed operational
requirements would be consistent with
the operational requirements in subpart
E of the current capital rule, with three
exceptions as described below. In
addition, for resecuritization exposures
131To segment a reference portfolio into different
levels of risks for different investors, the
securitization process divides the reference
portfolio into different slices, called tranches,
which receive cash flows or absorb losses based on
a predetermined order of priority. This payment
structure is known as the ‘‘cash flow waterfall,’’ or
simply the ‘‘waterfall.’’ The waterfall schedule
prioritizes the manner in which interest or
principal payments from the reference portfolio
must be allocated, creating different risk-return
profiles for each tranche.
132The proposal generally would use the same
approaches to determine the exposure amount of
securitization exposures.
that meet the operational requirements,
the proposal would eliminate the option
for banking organizations to treat the
exposures as if they had not been
securitized.
a. Early Amortization Provisions
Early amortization provisions cause
investors in securitization exposures to
be repaid before the original stated
maturity when certain conditions are
triggered. For example, many
securitizations of revolving credit
facilities, most commonly credit-card
receivable securitizations, contain
provisions that require the
securitization to be wound down and
investors repaid on an accelerated basis
if excess spread falls below a certain
threshold. This decrease in excess
spread would typically be caused by
credit deterioration in the underlying
exposures. Such provisions can expose
the originating banking organization to
increased credit and liquidity risk and
potentially increased capital
requirements after the early
amortization is triggered as the banking
organization could be obligated to fund
the borrowers’ future draws on the
revolving lines of credit. In such an
instance, the originating banking
organization may have to either find a
new funding source, whether internal or
external, to cover the new draws or
reduce borrowers’ credit line
availability.
The proposal would expand the
applicability of the operational
requirements regarding early
amortization provisions to synthetic
securitizations, similar to their
application to traditional securitizations
under subpart D of the current capital
rule. Under § . 2 of the current
capital rule, an early amortization
provision means a provision in the
documentation governing a
securitization that, when triggered,
causes investors in the securitization
exposure to be repaid before the original
stated maturity of the securitization
exposure, with certain exceptions.133
Under the proposal, if a synthetic
securitization includes an early
amortization provision and references
one or more underlying exposures in
which the borrower is permitted to vary
the drawn amount within an agreed
limit under a line of credit, the banking
133The exceptions to the current definition of
early amortization provision are a provision that: (1)
is triggered solely by events not directly related to
the performance of the underlying exposures or the
originating banking organization (such as material
changes in tax laws or regulations); or (2) leaves
investors fully exposed to future draws by
borrowers on the underlying exposures even after
the provision is triggered.
organization would be required to hold
risk-based capital against the underlying
exposures as if they had not been
synthetically securitized.
Question 62: What, if any, additional
exceptions to the early amortization
provision definition should the agencies
consider and why, provided such
exceptions would not incentivize a
banking organization to provide implicit
support to a securitization exposure?
b. Synthetic Excess Spread
The proposal would prohibit an
originating banking organization from
recognizing the risk-mitigating benefits
of a synthetic securitization that
includes synthetic excess spread.
Synthetic excess spread would be
defined in the proposal as any
contractual provision in a synthetic
securitization that is designed to absorb
losses prior to any of the tranches of the
securitization structure. Synthetic
excess spread is a form of credit
enhancement provided by the
originating banking organization to the
investors in the synthetic securitization;
therefore, the originating banking
organization should maintain capital
against the credit exposure represented
by the synthetic excess spread.
However, a risk-based capital
requirement for synthetic excess spread
may not be determinable with sufficient
precision to promote comparability
across banking organizations because
the amount of synthetic excess spread
made available to investors in the
synthetic securitization would depend
upon the maturity of the underlying
assets, which itself depends on whether
any of the underlying exposures have
defaulted or prepaid. In particular, the
total amount of synthetic excess spread
made available at inception to investors
over the life of the transaction may not
be known ex ante, as the outstanding
balance of the securitization in future
years is unknown. Therefore, if a
synthetic securitization structure
includes synthetic excess spread, the
banking organization would be required
under the proposal to maintain capital
against all the underlying exposures as
if they had not been synthetically
securitized.
Question 63: What clarifications or
modifications should the agencies
consider for the above proposed
definition of synthetic excess spread
and why?
Question 64: What are the advantages
and disadvantages of the proposed
treatment of synthetic securitizations
with synthetic excess spread? If the
agencies were to permit originating
banking organizations to recognize the
credit risk-mitigation benefits of

securitizations with synthetic excess
spread, how should the exposure
amount of the synthetic excess spread
be calculated, and what would be the
appropriate capital requirement for
synthetic excess spread?
c. Minimum Payment Threshold
Under the proposal, the operational
requirements for synthetic
securitizations would include a new
requirement that any applicable
minimum payment threshold for the
credit risk mitigant be consistent with
standard market practice. A minimum
payment threshold is a contractual
minimum amount that must be
delinquent before a credit event is
deemed to have occurred. The proposed
minimum payment threshold criterion
is intended to prohibit an originating
banking organization from recognizing
the capital reducing benefits of a
synthetic securitization whose
minimum payment threshold is so large
that it allows for material losses to occur
without triggering the credit protection
acquired by the protection purchaser, as
such provisions would interfere with an
effective transfer of credit risk.
Question 65: What are the benefits
and drawbacks of the proposed
minimum payment threshold criterion?
What, if any, additional criteria or
clarifications should the agencies
consider and why?
d. Resecuritization Exposures
For a resecuritization that is a
traditional securitization, if the
operational requirements have been
met, an originating banking organization
would be required to exclude the
transferred exposures from the
calculation of its risk-weighted assets
and maintain risk-based capital against
any
credit risk it retains in connection
with the resecuritization. Unlike in the
case of a securitization exposure that is
not a resecuritization, the proposal
would not allow a banking organization
the option to elect to treat a
resecuritization as if the underlying
exposures had not been re-securitized.
While a securitization of non-
securitized assets can be used to
diversify or transfer credit risk of those
exposures, a resecuritization might not
offer similar risk reduction or
diversification benefits, particularly if
the underlying exposures reflect similar
high-risk tranches of other
securitizations. Therefore, these
resecuritization exposures warrant a
higher regulatory capital requirement
than that applicable to the underlying
exposures.
Similarly, for a resecuritization that is
a synthetic securitization, if the
operational requirements have been
met, an originating banking organization
would be required to recognize for risk-
based capital purposes the use of a
credit risk mitigant to hedge the
underlying exposures and must hold
capital against any credit risk of the
exposures it retains in connection with
the synthetic securitization.
2. Securitization Standardized
Approach (SEC–SA)
Under the proposal, a banking
organization would determine the
capital requirements for most
securitization exposures under the SEC–
SA, which is substantively similar to the
SSFA in the current capital rule except
for certain changes as discussed below.
Under the SEC–SA, a banking
organization would determine the risk
weight for a securitization exposure
based on the risk weight of the
underlying assets, with adjustments to
reflect (1) delinquencies in such assets,
(2) the securitization exposure’s
subordination level in the allocation of
losses, and (3) the heightened
correlation and additional risks inherent
in securitizations relative to direct
credit exposures.
To calculate the risk weight for a
securitization exposure using the SEC–
SA, a banking organization must have
accurate information on the parameters
used in the SEC–SA calculation. If the
banking organization cannot, or chooses
not to, apply the SEC–SA, the banking
organization would be required to apply
a 1,250 percent risk weight to the
exposure.
a. Definition of Attachment Point and
Detachment Point
Under the current capital rule, the
attachment point (parameter A) of a
securitization exposure equals the ratio
of the current dollar amount of
underlying exposures that are
subordinated to the exposure of the
banking organization to the current
dollar amount of underlying exposures.
Any reserve account funded by the
accumulated cash flows from the
underlying exposures that is
subordinated to the banking
organization’s securitization exposure
may be included in the calculation of
parameter A to the extent that cash is
present in the account. The calculation
in the current capital rule does not
permit a banking organization to
recognize noncash assets in a reserve
account in the calculation of parameter
A. In contrast, the proposal would
permit a banking organization to
recognize all assets, cash or noncash,
that are included in a reserve account in
the calculation of parameter A.
64069
However, a banking organization would
not be allowed to include interest rate
derivative contracts and exchange rate
derivative contracts, or the cash
collateral accounts related to these
instruments, in the calculation of
parameters A and D. The agencies are
proposing this treatment because assets
held in a funded reserve account,
whether cash or noncash, can provide
credit enhancement to a securitization
exposure,
whereas interest rate and
foreign exchange derivatives (and any
cash collateral held against these
derivatives) do not.134
The proposal would modify the
definition of attachment point so that it
refers to the outstanding balance of the
underlying assets in the pool rather than
the current dollar value of the
underlying exposures. By referencing
the outstanding balance of the
underlying assets instead of the current
dollar amount of the underlying
exposures, the revised definition would
clarify that a banking organization may
recognize a nonrefundable purchase
price discount 135 when calculating the
attachment point of a securitization
exposure. A similar modification would
be made to the definition of detachment
point.136
b. Definition of W Parameter
Under the current capital rule,
parameter W, which is expressed as a
decimal value between zero and one,
reflects the proportion of underlying
exposures that are not performing or are
delinquent, according to criteria
outlined in the rule. The proposal
would apply a similar definition of
parameter W for subpart E, but clarify
that for resecuritization exposures, any
, 
134For example, if a securitization SPE has assets
denominated in U.S. Dollars and liabilities
denominated in Euros, and if the securitization SPE
executes a USD–EUR foreign exchange swap, the
swap hedges the foreign exchange risk between the
SPE’s assets and liabilities but does not provide
credit enhancement to any of the tranches of the
securitization.
135The proposal would define nonrefundable
purchase price discount to mean the difference
between the initial outstanding balance of the
exposures in the underlying pool and the price at
which these exposures are sold by the originator to
the securitization SPE, when neither originator nor
the original lender are reimbursed for this
difference. In cases where the originator
underwrites tranches of a NPL securitization for
subsequent sale, the NRPPD may include the
differences between the notional amount of the
tranches and the price at which these tranches are
first sold to unrelated third parties. For any given
piece of a securitization tranche, only its initial sale
from the originator to investors is taken into
account in the determination of NRPPD. The
purchase prices of subsequent re-sales are not
considered. See proposed definition in §ll.101.
136For the sake of consistency, the proposal
would also use the term ‘‘outstanding balance’’ in
the calculation of W and KG.

64070
Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 179 / Monday, September 18, 2023 / Proposed Rules
underlying exposure that is a
securitization exposure would only be
included in the denominator of the ratio
and would be excluded from the
numerator of the ratio. That is, for
resecuritization exposures, parameter W
would be the ratio of the sum of the
outstanding balance of any underlying
exposures of the securitization that meet
any of the criteria in paragraphs
ll.133(b)(1)(i) through (vi) of the
proposal that are not securitization
exposures to the outstanding balance of
all underlying exposures. Underlying
securitization exposures need not be
included in the numerator of parameter
W because the risk weight of the
underlying securitization exposure as
calculated by the SEC–SA already
reflects the impact of any delinquent or
otherwise nonperforming loans within
the underlying securitization exposure.
For example, if a resecuritization with a
notional amount of $10 million includes
underlying securitization exposures
with a notional amount of $5 million
and underlying non-securitization
exposures with a notional amount of $5
million, and if $500,000 of the non-
securitization exposures are delinquent,
the numerator for the W parameter
would be $500,000 while the
denominator for the W parameter would
be $10 million. This would be true
regardless of the delinquency status of
any of the securitization exposures.
c. Delinquency-Adjusted (KA) and Non-
Adjusted (KG) Weighted-Average Capital
Requirement of the Underlying
Exposures
Under the proposal, KA would reflect
the delinquency-adjusted, weighted-
average capital requirement of the
underlying exposures and would be a
function of KG and W. Under this
approach, in order to calculate
parameter W, and thus KA, the banking
organization must know the
delinquency status of all underlying
exposures in the securitization. KG
would equal the weighted average total
capital requirement of the underlying
exposures (with the outstanding balance
used as the weight for each exposure),
calculated using the risk weights
according to subpart E of the proposed
rule.
The agencies are proposing two
modifications to the definition of KG for
SEC–SA compared to the current KG as
used in the SSFA. First, for interest rate
derivative contracts and exchange rate
derivative contracts, the positive current
exposure times the risk weight of the
counterparty multiplied by 0.08 would
be included in the numerator of KG but
excluded from the denominator of KG. If
amounts related to interest rate and
exchange rate derivative contracts were
included in both the numerator and
denominator of KG, these contracts
could reduce the capital requirement of
securitization exposures even though
interest rate and exchange rate
derivative contracts do not provide any
credit enhancement to a securitization.
Second, if a banking organization
transfers credit risk via a synthetic
securitization to a securitization SPE
and if the securitization SPE issues
funded obligations to investors, the
banking organization would include the
total capital requirement (exposure
amount multiplied by risk weight
multiplied by 0.08) of any collateral
held by the securitization SPE in the
numerator of KG. The denominator of
KG is calculated without recognition of
the collateral. This ensures that if
collateral held at the SPE is invested in
credit-sensitive assets, the credit risk
associated with those assets will be
included in the banking organization’s
capital calculation. Consistent with
subpart D of the current capital rule,
under the proposal, the value of KG for
a resecuritization exposure would equal
the weighted average of two distinct KG
values, one for the underlying
securitization (which equals the
requirement calculated using the SEC–
SA), the other for the underlying
exposures (which equals the weighted
average capital requirement of the
underlying exposures).
capital
Question 66: Recognizing that
banking organizations may not always
know the delinquency status of all
underlying exposures, what would be
the benefits and drawbacks of allowing
a banking organization to use the SEC–
SA if the banking organization knows
the delinquency status for most, but not
all, of the underlying exposures? For
example, if the banking organization
knew the delinquency status of 95
percent of the exposures, it could (1)
split the underlying exposures into two
subpools, (2) calculate a weighted
average of the KA of the subpool
comprising the underlying exposures for
which the delinquency status is known,
(3) assign a value of 1 for KA of the other
subpool comprising exposures for which
the delinquency status is unknown, and
(4) assign a KA for the entire pool equal
to the weighted average of the KA for
each subpool. What other approaches
should the agencies consider and why?
d. Supervisory Calibration Parameter
(Supervisory Parameter p)
Under the proposal, a banking
organization would apply a supervisory
parameter p of 1.0 to securitization
exposures that are not resecuritization
exposures and a supervisory parameter
p of 1.5 to resecuritization exposures.
The proposed increase to the
supervisory parameter p for
securitizations that are not
resecuritization exposures from 0.5 to
1.0 would help to ensure that the
framework produces appropriately
conservative risk-based capital
requirements when combined with the
reduced risk weights applicable to
certain underlying assets under the
proposal that would be reflected in
lower values of KG and the proposed
reduction in the risk-weight floor under
SEC–SA for securitization exposures
that are not resecuritization
exposures.137
e. Supervisory Risk-Weight Floors
The SEC–SA would require banking
organizations to apply a risk weight
floor to all securitization exposures. The
SEC–SA is based on assumptions and
the risk weight floor ensures a minimum
level of capital is held to account for
modelling risks and correlation risks.138
The proposal would apply a risk weight
floor of 15 percent for securitization
exposures that are not resecuritization
exposures. The 15 percent risk weight
floor is most relevant for more senior
securitization exposures. While junior
tranches can absorb a significant
amount of credit risk, senior tranches
are still exposed to some amount of
credit risk on the underlying exposures.
Therefore, a minimum prudential
capital requirement continues to be
appropriate in the securitization
context.
For resecuritization exposures, the
proposed SEC–SA approach would
require banking organizations to apply a
risk-weight floor of at least 100 percent.
The proposed 100 percent supervisory
risk-weight floor for resecuritization
exposures is intended to capture the
greater complexity of such exposures
and heightened correlation risks
inherent in the underlying
securitization exposures.139
137See sections III.C.2 and III.D.2.d of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION for a more detailed
discussion of the reduced risk weights applicable to
certain underlying assets and the risk-weight floor,
respectively.
138 Default correlation is the likelihood that two
or more exposures will default at the same time.
139 In a typical securitization exposure that is not
a resecuritization, each underlying exposure is
subject to idiosyncratic default risks (for example,
the employment status of each obligor) which may
exhibit lower relative default correlation. In a
resecuritization exposure, the underlying
exposures, which are typically tranches of
securitizations, usually have credit enhancement
from more junior tranches that protects against
many idiosyncratic risks. Systematic risks are more
likely to generate defaults in the underlying
exposures of resecuritizations than idiosyncratic
risks, but systematic risks are also much more

Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 179 / Monday, September 18, 2023 / Proposed Rules
The proposal would also apply a
minimum risk weight of 100 percent to
NPL securitization exposures.
Compared to other securitizations, the
performance of NPL securitizations
depends more heavily on the servicer’s
ability to generate cashflows from the
workout of the underlying exposures,
typically through renegotiation of the
defaulted loans with the borrower or
enforcement against the collateral.
These idiosyncratic risks associated
with NPL securitizations merit a higher
minimum risk weight.
3. Exceptions to the SEC–SA Risk-Based
Capital Treatment for Securitization
Exposures
Securitization exposures sometimes
contain unique features that, if not
accounted for, could produce
inconsistent outcomes under the SEC–
SA or in some cases make the
calculation of the risk weight
inoperable. Thus, notwithstanding the
general application of SEC–SA, the
proposal would include additional
approaches to account for certain types
of securitization exposures, which
would more appropriately align the
capital requirement with the risk of the
exposure.
a. Nth-to-Default Credit Derivatives
Under the current capital rule, a
banking organization that has purchased
credit protection in the form of an nth-
to-default credit derivative is permitted
to recognize the risk mitigating benefits
of that derivative. The proposal would
not permit banking organizations to
recognize any risk-mitigating benefit for
nth-to-default credit derivatives in
which the banking organization is the
protection purchaser under either the
proposed credit risk mitigation
framework or under the proposed
securitization framework. Purchased
credit protection through nth-to-default
derivatives often does not correlate with
the hedged exposure which inhibits the
risk mitigating benefits of the
instrument.
For nth-to-default credit derivatives in
which the banking organization is the
protection provider, the proposal would
prohibit use of the securitization
framework and instead would require
banking organizations to calculate the
risk-weighted asset amount by
multiplying the aggregate risk weights of
the assets included in the basket up to
a maximum of 1,250 percent by the
notional amount of the protection
provided by the credit derivative. In
, 
correlated; therefore, resecuritizations typically
have higher default correlations than other types of
securitizations.
aggregating the risk weights, the (n-1)
assets with the lowest risk weight may
be excluded from the calculation. This
approach would require banking
organizations to maintain capital based
on the risk characteristics of all the
underlying assets in the basket on
which it is providing protection, while
accounting for the fact that the banking
organization is not required to make a
payment unless ‘‘n’’ names in the basket
default.
b. Derivative Contracts That Do Not
Provide Credit Enhancements
The proposal would provide a new
treatment for certain interest rate or
foreign exchange derivative contracts
that qualify as securitization exposures.
Some securitizations either make
payments to investors in a different
currency from the underlying exposures
or make fixed payments to investors
when the cash flows received on the
securitized assets are linked to a floating
interest rate. To neutralize these foreign
exchange or interest rate risks, the
securitization SPE may enter into a
derivative contract that mirrors the
currency or interest rate mismatch
between the exposures and the tranches.
Cash flows required to be made to the
derivative counterparty tend to have a
senior claim to the principal and
interest payment of the collateral, and
therefore tend not to provide credit
enhancement.
The proposal would require a banking
organization that acts as a counterparty
to these types of interest rate and foreign
exchange derivatives to set the risk
weight on such derivatives equal to the
risk weight calculated under the SEC–
SA for a securitization exposure that is
pari passu to the derivative contract or,
if such an exposure does not exist, the
risk weight of the next subordinated
tranche of the securitization exposure. A
banking organization may otherwise not
be able to calculate a risk weight for
these derivative contracts using the
SEC–SA because the attachment and
detachment points under the proposed
formula could equal one another,
rendering the formula inoperable. The
proposed treatment is intended to
appropriately reflect how the credit risk
associated with these derivative
contracts would be commensurate with
or less than the credit risk associated
with a pari passu tranche or the next
subordinated tranche of a securitization
exposure.
The current capital rule permits
banking organizations to assign a risk-
weighted asset amount for certain
derivative contracts that are
securitization exposures equal to the
exposure amount of the derivative
64071
contract (i.e., a risk weight of 100
percent). The proposal would eliminate
this option. The approaches for
derivative contracts described in
sections III.C.4. of this SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION (including the treatment for
derivative contracts that do not provide
credit enhancement described above)
are more risk-sensitive and reflective of
the risks than a flat 100 percent risk
weight.
i. Overlapping Exposures
The proposal would introduce new
provisions for overlapping exposures.140
First, the proposal would allow a
banking organization to treat two non-
overlapping securitization exposures as
overlapping to the degree that the
banking organization assumes that
obligations with respect to one of the
exposures covers obligations with
respect to the other exposure. For
example, if a banking organization
provides a full liquidity facility to an
ABCP program that is not contractually
required to fund defaulted assets and
the banking organization also holds
commercial paper issued by the ABCP
program, a banking organization would
be permitted to calculate risk-weighted
assets only for the liquidity facility if
the banking organization assumes, for
purposes of calculating risk-based
capital requirements, that the liquidity
facility would be required to fund the
defaulted assets. In this case, the
banking organization would be
maintaining capital to cover losses on
the commercial paper when calculating
capital requirements for the liquidity
facility, so there is no need to assign a
separate capital requirement for the
commercial paper held by the banking
organization.
Second, the proposal would also
allow a banking organization to
recognize an overlap between relevant
risk-based requirements for
securitization exposures under subpart
E and market risk covered positions
under subpart F, provided the banking
organization is able to calculate and
compare the capital requirements for the
relevant exposures. For example, a
banking organization could hold a
correlation trading position that would
be subject to the proposed requirements
under subpart F but would preclude
losses in all circumstances on a separate
securitization exposure held by the
banking organization that would be
subject to requirements under subpart E
under the proposal. In such cases, the

banking organization is exposed to the same risk to
the same obligor through multiple direct or indirect
exposures to that obligor.

proposal would allow the banking
organization to calculate the risk-based
requirement for the overlapping portion
of the exposures based on the greater of
the requirement under subpart E or
under subpart F.
Question 67: What challenges, if any,
would the option to recognize an
overlap between market risk covered
and noncovered positions introduce? To
what degree do banking organizations
anticipate recognizing overlaps between
market risk covered and noncovered
positions?
ii. Look-Through Approach for Senior
Securitization Exposures
The proposal would introduce a
provision that would allow a banking
organization to cap the risk weight
applied to a senior securitization
exposure that is not a resecuritization
exposure at the weighted-average risk
weight of the underlying exposures,
provided that the banking organization
has knowledge of the composition of all
of the underlying exposures (also
referred to as the ‘‘look-through
approach’’). For purposes of calculating
the weighted-average risk weight, the
unpaid principal balance would be used
as the weight for each exposure. The
proposal would define a senior
securitization exposure as an exposure
that has a first priority claim on the cash
flows from the underlying exposures.
When determining whether a
securitization exposure has a first
priority claim on the cash flows from
the underlying exposures, a banking
organization would not be required to
consider amounts due under interest
rate derivative contracts, exchange rate
derivative contracts, and servicer cash
advance facility contracts,141 or any fees
and other similar payments to be made
by the securitization SPE to other
parties. Both the most senior
commercial paper issued by an ABCP
program and a liquidity facility that
supports the ABCP program may
be
senior securitization exposures if the
liquidity facility provider’s right to
reimbursement of the drawn amounts is
senior to all claims on the cash flows
from the underlying exposures, except
amounts due under interest rate
derivative contracts, exchange rate
derivative contracts, and servicer cash
141A servicer cash advance facility means a
facility under which the servicer of the underlying
exposures of a securitization may advance cash to
ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to
investors in the securitization, including advances
made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses
to facilitate the timely collection of the underlying
exposures.
advance facility contracts, fees due, and
other similar payments.
Accordingly, under the proposed
look-through approach, if a senior
securitization exposure’s underlying
pool of assets consists solely of loans
with a weighted average risk weight of
100 percent, the risk weight for the
senior securitization exposure would be
the lower of the risk weight calculated
under the SEC–SA and 100 percent. The
proposed risk-weight cap is intended to
recognize that the credit risk associated
with each dollar of a senior
securitization exposure generally will
not be greater than the credit risk
associated with each dollar of the
underlying assets, because the non-
senior tranches of a securitization
provide credit enhancement to the
senior tranche.
Notwithstanding the proposed risk
weight cap, the proposal would require
banking organizations to floor the total
risk-based capital requirement under the
look-through approach at 15 percent,
consistent with the proposed 15 percent
floor under the SEC–SA. The proposed
15 percent floor, even if it results in a
risk weight amount greater than the risk
weight cap, is intended to appropriately
reflect the minimum amount of risk-
based capital that a banking
organization should maintain for such
exposures given that the process of
securitization can introduce additional
risks that are not present in the
underlying exposures such as modelling
risks and correlation risks.
iii. Credit-Enhancing Interest Only
Strips
The proposal would require a banking
organization to deduct from common
equity tier 1 capital any portion of a
CEIO strip 142 that does not constitute an
after-tax-gain-on sale, regardless of
whether the securitization exposure
meets the proposed operational
requirements. The proposed treatment
for CEIOs would be different than under
subpart D of the current capital rule,
which requires a risk weight of 1,250
percent for these items. The agencies are
proposing to require deduction from
common equity tier 1 capital because
valuations of CEIOs can include a high
degree of subjectivity and, just like
assets subject to deduction under the
current capital rule such as goodwill
and other intangible assets, banking
organizations may not be able to fully
realize value from CEIOs based on their
balance sheet carrying amounts. While a
deduction is generally equivalent to a
1,250 percent risk weight when the
142See §ll.2 for the definition of credit-
enhancing interest-only strip.
banking organization maintains an 8
percent capital ratio, given the various
capital ratios, buffers, and add-ons
applicable to banking organizations
subject to subpart E, applying a
deduction provides a more consistent
treatment across ratios and banking
organizations.
iv. NPL Securitizations
The proposal would define an NPL
securitization as a securitization whose
underlying exposures consist solely of
loans where parameter W for the
underlying pool is greater than or equal
to 90 percent at the origination cut-off
date 143 and at any subsequent date on
which assets are added to or removed
from the pool due to replenishment or
restructuring. A securitization exposure
that meets the definition of a
resecuritization exposure would be
excluded from the definition of an NPL
securitization.
In a typical NPL securitization, the
originating banking organization sells
the non-performing loans to a
securitization SPE at a significant
discount to the outstanding loan
balances (reflecting the nonperforming
nature of the underlying exposures) and
this discount acts as a credit
enhancement to investors. Unlike the
performance of securitizations of
performing loans, which principally
depend on the cash flows of the
underlying loans, the performance of
NPL securitizations depends in part on
the performance of workouts on
defaulted loans, which are uncertain
and could be volatile, and on the
liquidation of underlying collateral for
those loans which are unable to be
cured.
The proposal would introduce a
specific approach for NPL securitization
exposures as the proposed SEC–SA may
be inappropriate for the unique risks of
such exposures. The proposal would
require a banking organization to assign
a risk weight of 100 percent to a
securitization exposure to an NPL
securitization if the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) the
transaction structure meets the
definition of a traditional securitization;
(2) the securitization has a credit
enhancement in the form of a
nonrefundable purchase price discount
greater than or equal to 50 percent of the
outstanding balance of the pool of
exposures; and (3) the banking
organization’s exposure is a senior
143Cut-off date is the date on which the
composition of the asset pool collateralizing a
securitization transaction is established. This means
that all assets to be included in a securitization
must already be in existence and meet the NPL
criteria as of that date.

securitization exposure as described in
section III.D.3.b.ii. of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.144 Using
the SEC–SA for senior securitizations of
NPLs that meet these criteria would
result in capital requirements that do
not reflect the nonrefundable purchase
price discount associated with these
transactions. The SEC–SA is calibrated
on the basis that the loans in the pool
at origination are generally performing
and is therefore inappropriate for senior
exposures to securitizations of NPLs
that meet these criteria.
If the NPL securitization exposure is
not a senior securitization exposure or
the purchase price discount is less than
50 percent, the banking organization
would be required to use the SEC–SA to
calculate the risk weight (subject to a
risk weight floor of 100 percent and
reflecting all delinquent exposures in
calculating parameter W). If the
exposure does not meet the
requirements of the SEC–SA, the
banking organization must assign a risk
weight of 1,250 to the exposure.
I. Attachment and Detachment Points
for NPL Securitizations
Under the proposal, the
nonrefundable purchase price discount
would equal the difference between the
outstanding balance of the underlying
exposures and the price at which these
exposures are sold by the originator 145
to investors on a final basis without
recourse through the securitization SPE,
when neither the originator nor the
original lender are eligible for future
reimbursement for this difference (that
is, that the purchase price discount is
‘‘non-refundable’’). In cases where the
originator underwrites tranches of the
NPL securitization for subsequent sale,
a banking organization may include in
the calculation of the nonrefundable
purchase price discount the differences
between the outstanding balance of the
underlying nonperforming loans and the
price at which the tranches are first sold
to third parties unrelated to the
originator. For any given piece of a
securitization tranche, a banking
organization may only take into account
the initial sale from the originator to
investors in the determination of the
. 
144 If the banking organization is an originating
banking organization with respect to the NPL
securitization, the banking organization may
maintain risk-based capital against the transferred
exposures as if they had not been securitized and
must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any
after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction
and any portion of a CEIO strip that does not
constitute an after-tax gain-on-sale.
145While originator typically refers to the party
originating the underlying loans, in the NPL context
it refers to the party arranging the NPL
securitization (i.e., the securitizer).
nonrefundable purchase price discount
and may not account for any subsequent
secondary re-sales.
Since the calculation of parameters A
and D both depend on the outstanding
balance of the assets in the underlying
pool, any nonrefundable purchase price
discount associated with a
securitization would be included in
both the numerator and denominator of
parameters A and D. For example,
assume an originating banking
organization transfers a pool of mortgage
loans with an outstanding balance of
$100 million to a securitization SPE at
a price of $60 million. The
nonrefundable purchase price discount
would be the difference between the
unpaid principal balances on the
underlying mortgages at the time of sale
to the securitization SPE and the price
at which the originating banking
organization sold these mortgages to the
securitization SPE (that is, $40 million).
Assume that the securitization SPE
issues $60 million in securitization
tranches of which the banking
organization retains the senior $50
million tranche and an investing
banking organization purchases the $10
million first-loss tranche. Parameter A
for the investing banking organization’s
exposure would equal 40 percent (that
is, the ratio of $40 million to $100
million). Thus, the discount paid for the
underlying assets is effectively the ‘‘first
loss’’ position in the securitization.
Likewise, the originating banking
organization would treat both the
nonrefundable purchase price discount
and the investing banking organization’s
tranche as subordinate and would set
Parameter A at 50 percent.
If, in the example above, the
originating bank sells both tranches and
each tranche is sold at a 20 percent
discount (that is, the $10 million first
loss tranche is sold for a price of $8
million and the $50 million senior
tranche is sold for a price of $40
million), the investing banking
organization that purchases the first-loss
tranche would be permitted to assign an
attachment point of 52 percent to its
exposure, because the nonrefundable
purchase price discount would be the
difference between the original
outstanding amount of the exposures
($100 million) and the total notional
value of all the securitization tranches
($48 million). The investing banking
organization that purchases the senior
tranche would be permitted to assign an
attachment point of 60 percent to the
exposure.
4. Credit Risk Mitigation for
Securitization Exposures
64073
The proposal would replace the
existing credit risk mitigation
framework under subpart E with a
framework that is consistent with the
credit risk mitigation framework under
subpart D of the current capital rule,146
with one exception. A banking
organization that purchases or sells
tranched credit protection, whether
hedged or unhedged, referencing part of
a senior tranche would not be allowed
to treat the lower-priority portion that
the credit protection does not reference
as a senior securitization exposure. For
example, if a banking organization holds
a securitization exposure with an
attachment point of 20 percent and a
detachment point of 100 percent and the
banking organization purchases an
eligible guarantee with an attachment
point of 50 percent and a detachment
point of 100 percent, the banking
organization’s residual exposure, which
attaches at 20 percent and detaches at
50 percent, would be considered a non-
senior securitization exposure, and the
banking organization would not be
permitted to apply the look-through
approach to this exposure. A banking
organization that purchases a mezzanine
tranche that attaches at 20 percent and
detaches at 50 percent has a similar
economic exposure to a banking
organization that purchases a senior
tranche that attaches at 20 percent and
detaches at 100 percent and then
purchases credit protection that attaches
at 50 percent and detaches at 100
percent. Since the former transaction
would not be considered a senior
securitization exposure eligible for the
look-through approach, the agencies
believe that the latter transaction
likewise should not be eligible for the
look-through approach. Alternatively,
the banking organization may choose
not to recognize the tranched credit
protection, in which case, the banking
organization may treat the securitization
exposure (which attaches at 20 percent
and detaches at 100 percent) as a senior
securitization exposure.
E. Equity Exposures
Equity exposures present a greater
risk of loss relative to credit exposures
as equity exposures represent an
ownership interest in the issuer of an
146 In particular, the proposal would eliminate
references to model-based approaches that are
currently contained in subpart E. The proposal
would also eliminate the formula for collateral
recognition under subpart E, which includes
standard supervisory haircuts calibrated to a 65-day
holding period and permits banking organizations
to calculate their own estimates of haircuts with
prior supervisory approval.

equity instrument and have a lower
priority of payment or reimbursement in
the event that the issuing entity fails to
meet its credit obligations. For example,
an equity exposure entitles a banking
organization to no more than the pro-
rata residual value of a company after
all other creditors, including
subordinated debt holders, are repaid.
As a result, consistent with the current
capital rule, the proposal would
generally assign higher risk weights to
equity exposures than exposures subject
to the proposed credit risk framework.
The current capital rule’s advanced
approaches equity framework permits
use of an internal models approach for
publicly traded and non-publicly traded
equity exposures and equity derivative
contracts. The proposal would not
include an internal models approach
because of the types of equity exposures
that would likely be subject to the
equity framework. Under the proposal,
material publicly traded equity
exposures would generally be subject to
the proposed market risk framework
described in section III.H of this
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, unless
there are restrictions on the tradability
of such exposures.147 Similarly, equity
exposures to investment funds for
which the banking organization has
access to the investment fund’s
prospectus, partnership agreement, or
similar contract that defines the fund’s
permissible investments and investment
limits, and is either able to (1) calculate
a market risk capital requirement for its
proportional ownership share of each
exposure held by the investment fund,
or (2) obtain daily price quotes—would
generally be subject to the proposed
market risk framework.148 As the
proposed equity framework would
primarily cover illiquid or infrequently
traded equity exposures, the proposal
would require banking organizations to
use a standardized approach to
determine capital requirements for such
147While the proposal would require banking
organizations that are not subject to the proposed
market risk capital framework to calculate risk-
weighted assets for all publicly traded equity
exposures under the proposed equity framework,
such entities typically do not have material equity
exposures.
148See §.202 for the proposed definition of
market risk covered position.
,
equity exposures. This is intended to
increase the transparency of the capital
framework and facilitate comparisons of
capital adequacy across banking
organizations.
The proposed framework would
largely maintain those sections of the
current capital rule’s equity framework
that do not rely on models, including
the definition of equity exposure,149 the
definition of investment fund, the
treatment of stable value protection, and
the methods for measuring the exposure
amount for equity exposures. The
proposal would make certain
modifications to improve the risk
sensitivity and robustness of the risk-
based capital requirements for equity
exposures relative to the current capital
rule. Specifically, the proposal would:
(1) eliminate the 100 percent risk weight
threshold category under the simple
risk-weight approach for non-significant
equity exposures; (2) eliminate the
effective and ineffective hedge pair
treatment under the simple risk-weight
approach; (3) align the conversion
factors for conditional commitments to
acquire an equity exposure, consistent
with the proposed off-balance sheet
treatment for exposures subject to the
proposed credit risk framework, and (4)
increase the risk weight applicable to
equity exposures to investment firms
with greater than immaterial leverage
that the primary Federal supervisor has
determined do not qualify as a
traditional securitization. Additionally,
the proposal would enhance the risk-
sensitivity of the current capital rule’s
look-through approaches for equity
exposures to investment funds by (1)
specifying a hierarchy of approaches
that a banking organization would be
required to use based on the nature and
quality of the information available to
the banking organization concerning the
investment fund’s underlying assets and
liabilities; (2) modifying the full look-
through and the alternative look-
through approaches to explicitly capture
off-balance sheet exposures held by an
investment fund, the counterparty credit
risk and CVA risk of any underlying
derivatives held by the investment fund,
149See 12 CFR 3.2 (OCC); 12 CFR 217.2 (Board);
12 CFR 324.2 (FDIC).
and the leverage of the investment fund;
(3) replacing the simple modified look-
through approach with a flat 1,250
percent risk weight, and (4) flooring the
risk weight applicable to an equity
exposure to an investment fund at 20
percent, consistent with the
standardized approach in the current
capital rule.
1. Risk-Weighted Asset Amount
The proposal would retain the risk-
weighted asset amount calculation
under the current capital rule.
Consistent with the current capital rule,
the proposal would require a banking
organization to determine the risk-
weighted asset amount for each equity
exposure, except for equity exposures to
investment funds, by multiplying the
adjusted carrying value of the exposure
by the lowest applicable risk weight, as
described below in section III.E.1.b. of
this SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. A
banking organization would determine
the risk-weighted asset amount for an
equity exposure to an investment fund
by multiplying the adjusted carrying
value of the exposure by either the risk
weight calculated under one of the look-
through approaches or by a risk weight
of 1,250 percent, as described below in
section III.E.1.c. of this SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION. A banking organization
would calculate its aggregate risk-
weighted asset amount for equity
exposures as the sum of the risk-
weighted asset amount calculated for
each equity exposure.150
a. Adjusted Carrying Value
Under the proposal, the adjusted
carrying value of an equity exposure,
including equity exposures to
investment funds, would be based on
the type of exposure, as described in
Table 6 below.
BILLING CODE 6210–01–P; 6714–01–P; 4810–33–P
150The proposal would exclude from the
proposed equity framework equity exposures that a
banking organization would be required to deduct
from regulatory capital under §ll.22(d)(2)(i)(C) of
the proposal. The proposal would require a banking
organization to assign a 250 percent risk weight to
the amount of the significant investments in the
common stock of unconsolidated financial
institutions that is not deducted from common
equity tier 1 capital.

Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 179 / Monday, September 18, 2023 / Proposed Rules
The proposal would maintain the
current capital rule’s methods for
calculating the adjusted carrying value
for equity exposures, with one
exception. The proposal would simplify
the treatment of conditional
commitments to acquire an equity
exposure to remove the differentiation
of conversion factors by maturity. The
proposal would require a banking
organization to multiply the effective
. 
notional principal amount of a
conditional commitment by a 40 percent
conversion factor to calculate its
adjusted carrying value. The 40 percent
conversion factor is meant to
appropriately account for the risk of
conditional equity commitments, which
provide the banking organization more
flexibility to exit the commitment
relative to unconditional equity
commitments.
b. Expanded Simple Risk-Weight
Approach (ESRWA)
Under the proposal, the risk-weighted
asset amount for an equity exposure,
except for equity exposures to
investment funds, would be the product
of the adjusted carrying value of the
equity exposure multiplied by the
lowest applicable risk weight in Table 7.
151Consistent with the current capital rule, the
proposal would allow a banking organization to
choose not to hold risk-based capital against the
counterparty credit risk of equity derivative
contracts, as long as it does so for all such contracts.
Where the equity derivative contracts are subject to
a qualified master netting agreement, the proposal
would require the banking organization to either
include all or exclude all of the contracts from any
measure used to determine counterparty credit risk
exposure. See §.113(d) of the proposal.. 
152Consistent with the current capital rule, the
proposal includes the concept of the effective
notional principal amount of the off-balance sheet
portion of an equity exposure to provide a uniform
method for banking organizations to measure the
on-balance sheet equivalent of an off-balance sheet
exposure. For example, if the value of a derivative
contract referencing the common stock of company
X changes the same amount as the value of 150
shares of common stock of company X, for a small
change (for example, 1.0 percent) in the value of the
common stock of company X, the effective notional
principal amount of the derivative contract is the
current value of 150 shares of common stock of
company X, regardless of the number of shares the
derivative contract references. The adjusted
carrying value of the off-balance sheet component
of the derivative is the current value of 150 shares
of common stock of company X minus the adjusted
carrying value of any on-balance sheet amount
associated with the derivative.

10 percent of the banking organization’s

respectively. Given the removal of the
100 percent risk weight threshold
category for non-significant equity
exposures and the revised scope of
equity exposures subject to the
proposed equity framework, the
proposal would (1) assign a 100 percent
risk weight to equity exposures to Small
Business Investment Companies and (2)
generally assign a 250 percent risk
weight to publicly traded equity
exposures with restrictions on

detail below. Finally, the proposal
would introduce a 1,250 percent risk
weight to replace the 600 percent risk
weight in the simple risk-weight
approach under subpart E of the current
capital rule for equity exposures to
investment firms that have greater than
immaterial leverage and that the
primary Federal supervisor has
determined do not qualify as a
traditional securitization exposure, as
described in more detail below.
Removing the 100 percent risk weight
for non-significant equity exposures is
intended to increase the risk sensitivity
of the equity framework by requiring
banking organizations to apply a risk
weight based on the characteristics of
each equity exposure, rather than only
for those in excess of 10 percent of the
banking organization’s total capital.
Given that primarily illiquid or
infrequently traded equity positions
would be subject to the proposed equity
framework, the proposal would remove
the 100 and 300 percent risk weights
under the current capital rule for the
effective and ineffective portions of
hedge pairs. The hedge pair treatment
under the current capital rule is only
available if each of the equity exposures
is publicly traded or has a return that is
primarily based on a publicly traded
equity exposure. As such positions
would generally be subject to the
proposed market risk capital framework
under the proposal, the agencies are
proposing to eliminate the hedge pair
treatment to simplify the risk-weighting
framework under the proposal.
i. Community Development Investments
and Small Business Investment
Companies
The current capital rule assigns a 100
percent risk weight to equity exposures
that either (1) qualify as a community
development investment under section
24 (Eleventh) of the National Bank Act,
or (2) represent non-significant equity
exposures to the extent that the
aggregate adjusted carrying value of the
exposures does not exceed 10 percent of
the banking organization’s total capital.
Under the current capital rule, when
determining which equity exposures are
‘‘non-significant’’ and thus eligible for a
100 percent risk weight, a banking
organization first must include equity
exposures to an unconsolidated small
business investment company or held
through a consolidated small business
investment company described in
section 302 of the Small Business
Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C.
percent risk weight to all publicly traded equity
positions that are not equity exposures to
investment funds.
682).156 As depository institutions are
limited by statute to only invest up to
5 percent of total capital in the equity
exposures and debt instruments of small
business investment companies, the
current capital rule effectively assigns a
100 percent risk weight to all equity
exposures to such programs.
Equity exposures to community
development investments and small
business investment companies
generally receive favorable tax treatment
and/or investment subsidies that make
their risk and return characteristics
different than equity investments in
general. Recognizing this more favorable
risk-return structure and the importance
of these investments to promoting
important public welfare goals, the
proposal would effectively retain the
treatment of equity exposures that
qualify as community development
investments and equity exposures to
small business investment companies
under the current capital rule and assign
such exposures a 100 percent risk
weight.
ii. Publicly Traded Equity With
Tradability Restrictions 157
To appropriately capture the risk of
publicly traded equity exposures with
restrictions on tradability, the proposal
would (1) eliminate the 100 percent risk
weight for non-significant equity
exposures up to 10 percent of total
capital under the current capital rule;
and (2) introduce a 250 percent risk
weight to replace the current capital
rule’s 300 percent risk weight applicable
to publicly traded exposures.158 The
revised calibration of the risk-weight for
publicly traded equity exposures with
restrictions on tradability is intended to
take into account the removal of the
non-significant equity exposures
treatment. Under the proposal, banking
organizations would no longer assign
separate risk weights (100 percent and
300 percent) to publicly traded equity
exposures based on factors that are
unrelated to the underlying risk of the
exposure. Instead, the proposal would
assign an identical 250 percent risk
weight to all publicly traded equity
exposures with restrictions on
tradability, improving the consistency
and risk-sensitivity of the framework.

156See 12 CFR 3.152(b)(3)(iii)(B) (OCC); 12 CFR
217.152(b)(3)(iii)(B) (Board); 12 CFR
324.152(b)(3)(iii)(B) (FDIC).
157The proposal would require banking
organizations that are not subject to the proposed
market risk capital framework to calculate risk-
weighted assets for all publicly traded equity
exposures under the proposed equity framework.
158Equity exposures, including preferred stock
exposures, to the FHLBs and Farmer Mac would
continue to receive a 20 percent risk weight.

iii. Equity Exposures to Investment
Firms With Greater Than Immaterial
Leverage and That Would Meet the
Definition of a Traditional
Securitization Were It Not for the
Application of Paragraph (8) of That
Definition
Consistent with the current capital
rule, the proposed securitization
framework generally would apply to
exposures to investment firms with
material liabilities that are not operating
companies,159 unless the primary
Federal supervisor determines the
exposure is not a traditional
securitization based on its leverage, risk
profile or economic substance.160 161 For
an equity exposure to an investment
firm that has greater than immaterial
leverage and that the primary Federal
supervisor has determined does not
qualify as a traditional securitization
exposure, the proposal would increase
the 600 percent risk weight in the
simple risk-weight approach under
subpart E of the current capital rule to
1,250 percent under the proposed
expanded simple risk-weight approach.
159Operating companies generally refer to
companies that are established to conduct business
with clients with the intention of earning a profit
in their own right and generally produce goods or
provide services beyond the business of investing,
reinvesting, holding, or trading in financial assets.
Accordingly, an equity investment in an operating
company generally would be an equity exposure
under the proposal and subject to the proposed
enhanced simple risk-weight approach. Consistent
with the current capital rule, under the proposal,
banking organizations would be operating
companies and would not fall under the definition
of a traditional securitization. However, investment
firms that generally do not produce goods or
provide services beyond the business of investing,
reinvesting, holding, or trading in financial assets,
would not be operating companies, and would not
qualify for the general exclusion from the definition
of traditional securitization.
160 In general, such entities qualify as ‘‘traditional
securitizations’’ unless explicitly scoped out by
criterion (10) of that definition (for example
collective investment funds, as defined in 12 CFR
208.34, as well as entities registered with the SEC
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15
U.S.C. 80a–1, or foreign equivalents thereof). As the
definition of ‘‘traditional securitization’’ does not
include exposures to entities where all or
substantially all of the underlying exposures are not
financial exposures, equity exposures to Real Estate
Investment Trusts (REITs) generally would be
treated in a similar manner to equity exposures to
operating companies and, unless they qualify as
market risk covered positions, would be subject to
the proposed expanded simple risk-weight
approach of the equity framework.
161For example, for an equity security issued by
a qualifying venture capital fund, as defined under
§.10(c)(16) of each agency’s regulations
implementing section 13 of the BHC Act, that also
has outstanding debt securities, the proposal would
generally require a banking organization to treat the
exposure as a traditional securitization exposure if
the exposure would meet all of the criteria of the
definition of traditional securitization under
§ll.2 of the current capital rule unless the
primary Federal supervisor determines the
exposure is not a traditional securitization.
